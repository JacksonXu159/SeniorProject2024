retirement,A guide to retirement withdrawal strategies,"How much can you spend in retirement?
Most people spend years saving for retirement. Then, when the time comes to begin spending their savings, they have no strategy in place.

Many studies—including our own research1—have shown that successful retired investors often don't spend much of their retirement savings, and their money continues to grow. It's not a terrible problem to have, but it could mean these investors are being overly frugal in retirement because they're not sure how much they can ""safely"" spend.

See other behavioral factors that can affect retirement spending

It's crucial to have a strategy for accumulating retirement assets. Equally important is a strategy to withdraw from your retirement savings. Your withdrawal strategy should accomplish 2 often-competing goals:

Having enough money to support your desired lifestyle.
Ensuring there's enough left for the future, including any money you plan to leave to heirs.
There are several ways to successfully withdraw from your retirement savings. Our advisors can help you determine which approach might work best for you.

Traditional retirement withdrawal strategies
The dollar-plus-inflation strategy calls for you to spend a percentage of your portfolio the first year and adjust that amount in subsequent years based on inflation.

Here are some things to know about this strategy:

The ""4% rule"" is a popular example of the dollar-plus-inflation strategy. Here's how it works. You withdraw 4% of your portfolio in your first year of retirement. Then, in each subsequent year, the amount you withdraw increases with the rate of inflation. If you don't expect your expenses to change much throughout retirement, this strategy can help ensure you'll be able to cover your yearly costs for as long as the portfolio lasts (goal 1).
It ignores market conditions, so you could end up running out of money (in down markets) or spending much less than you can afford (in up markets).
It could be best for you if you plan to maintain a steady level of spending from year to year, adjusted for inflation.
The percentage-of-portfolio strategy calls for you to spend a fixed percentage of your portfolio every year. This strategy:

Gives you confidence of achieving goal 2—not running out of money.
Results in yearly spending amounts that are completely market-driven and could fall short of what you need to live. Favorable market conditions could also push you into taking out more than you need.
Could make sense for you if your main concern is ensuring you don't deplete your portfolio and you can adapt your budget to a wide range of spending levels.
As the name implies, a fixed-dollar withdrawal strategy involves taking the same amount of money out of your retirement account every year for a set time, then reassessing. It can:

Provide a predictable income stream, which can be helpful for budgeting and planning. You'll know exactly how much money you'll be withdrawing each year.
Add a level of simplicity. Fixed-dollar withdrawals are relatively easy to manage, and you don't need to constantly adjust your withdrawal amounts.
Leave you exposed to the risks of inflation.
Once you figure out how much to withdraw from your portfolio, the next step is to determine which assets to withdraw from. This is when the withdrawal “buckets” strategy comes into play.  This strategy divides your retirement savings into 3 buckets: short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term.

The short-term bucket should contain money you'll need to live on for the next 3–5 years. You should consider investing this money in traditionally safe, liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term bonds.
The intermediate bucket should contain money to cover expenses for the next 5–10 years. Consider longer-term, high-quality bonds and certain stocks, including utilities and REITs for this investment.
The long-term bucket should hold investments that will continue to grow throughout your retirement. This is where you may want to consider stocks and long-term bonds.

How to choose an initial withdrawal amount
No matter which strategy you choose, you'll start by selecting a withdrawal amount for the first year. As you do this, you’ll want to consider factors like your total liquid assets, other sources of income, sensitivity to income taxes, and Medicare surcharges. In the planning phase, many retirement calculators rely on this as a critical component to determine how much you need to save.

Although 4% is a popular guideline, some experts believe it’s ""safe"" only for specific time frames and allocations. And safe means different things to different people. For you, 4% could be too much—or too little. Here are the factors we consider when choosing a withdrawal rate for a client:

Dynamic withdrawal strategy
Since many people equally prioritize spending levels and portfolio preservation, we created a retirement strategy that helps achieve both important goals—covering current spending while aiming to preserve enough money for the future.

Dynamic spending is a hybrid of the dollar-plus-inflation and percentage-of-portfolio strategies. It builds on people's natural tendency to spend more when markets are up and less when markets are down—but moderates the wild swings you get when giving market performance free rein over your spending.

In other words, it achieves a happy medium. Your spending is more flexible than with the dollar-plus-inflation approach but also more stable than with the percentage-of-portfolio approach. It's also completely customizable, so in addition to deciding how much to withdraw the first year, you decide how much you're willing (and able) to raise or lower your spending in response to market movements.

To use dynamic spending, you calculate the upcoming year's spending by adjusting the amount of this year's spending based on your portfolio return for the year. But you don't go any higher than the ""ceiling"" or any lower than the ""floor"" you set as part of your strategy. 

Dynamic spending on FIRE
Careful spending is even more important for early retirees. We looked at sustainable withdrawal rates for the ""financial independence retire early"" (FIRE) community and found a safe withdrawal rate of 3.3% for someone with a 50-year time frame using the dollar-plus-inflation strategy. But by using dynamic spending instead, the safe rate increased to 4.0%.4

Setting your floor and ceiling as well as deciding on the right initial withdrawal rate means you'll need to make several decisions and maintain an additional level of oversight to use dynamic spending. And since all these factors depend on your personal time horizon, asset allocation, retirement income sources, and priorities, there's no right answer for everyone.

If you're interested in incorporating dynamic spending into your withdrawal strategy, you can learn more in our research paper, or set up a consultation with a Vanguard advisor.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/retirement-withdrawal-strategies,
retirement,Do you have to pay taxes on Social Security?,"You may not have considered this, but there's a good chance you'll have to pay tax on some portion of your Social Security benefits. The percentage of benefits that are taxable will depend on your income and filing status.

The IRS uses your ""combined income"" to determine if—and how much—you'll owe in federal taxes. Your combined income includes half of your Social Security benefits, your adjusted gross income, and any tax-exempt interest income.

You won't be taxed on all your benefits, but if your combined income exceeds $25,000 a year (as an individual taxpayer), or $32,000 (for a married couple filing jointly), then a portion of your benefits will be subject to federal taxes.

According to a 2024 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, approximately half of Social Security beneficiaries paid federal income tax on their benefits in 2021. The proportion of people who owe income tax on their benefits is expected to rise in the years ahead, since the thresholds that determine who owes tax aren't adjusted for inflation or wage growth. 

Understanding Social Security taxes
Because the rules around taxes and Social Security will vary based on several factors, it's helpful to have a good understanding of your situation and which rules will apply to you. 

When is Social Security taxable?
The taxability of Social Security income depends on your combined income.

Understanding the income thresholds and how much of your Social Security income is taxable can help you plan your finances and minimize your tax liability.

Filing status	Combined income range	Taxable portion of benefits
Single	$25,000 to $34,000	Up to 50%
Single	More than $34,000	Up to 85%
Married filing jointly	$32,000 to $44,000	Up to 50%
Married filing jointly	More than $44,000	Up to 85%
The IRS also has an online tool to help you calculate the amount you may owe. 

Options for paying tax on Social Security
If you know you'll be taxed on Social Security, you have a few payment options. You can choose to have 7%, 10%, 12%, or 22% of your benefit withheld from your monthly payments—essentially prepaying a portion of your tax bill. If you're already receiving your benefits and want to start withholding taxes (or change your withholding amount), you'll need to fill out a Form W-4V from the IRS.

You can also opt to make quarterly estimated tax payments or file a tax return by the annual tax-filing deadline. Each method has its pros and cons, so consider your preferences and choose the one that best fits your financial situation.

Is Social Security disability taxable?
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments and Social Security retirement benefits differ in several ways, including how they're taxed. Unlike retirement benefits, SSDI payments are generally not subject to federal income tax if they are your only source of income. However, if you have other income sources, such as wages, investment income, or a pension, the SSDI payments may become partially taxable. Your combined income will include half of your SSDI benefits.

SSDI benefits are subject to the same income thresholds as Social Security retirement benefits, as shown in the above chart. It's important to note that state tax laws can vary, and some states may tax SSDI benefits.

Are Social Security survivor benefits taxable?
When it comes to Social Security survivor benefits, the tax rules are similar to those for other Social Security benefits. Since state tax laws can vary, it's a good idea to check your state's rules or consult a tax professional to ensure you're fully prepared.

There are some age-related considerations and other rules for a surviving spouse when it comes to taxes on Social Security survivor benefits. Doing some research can help you make a plan based on your situation.

Federal vs. state Social Security taxes
Social Security benefits can be subject to both federal and state income taxes, but the rules vary. 

Federal taxes on Social Security. At the federal level, if you're a single filer and your combined income is between $25,000 and $34,000, up to 50% of your benefits may be taxable. If your combined income exceeds $34,000, up to 85% of your benefits could be taxable. For married couples filing jointly, the thresholds are $32,000 to $44,000 for up to 50% taxability, and over $44,000 for up to 85% taxability. If Social Security is your only income, you typically won't owe federal income tax on it.

State taxes on Social Security. At the state level, the situation varies based on where you live. While most states don't tax Social Security benefits at all, you may have to pay taxes on Social Security benefits if you live in Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia . Each of these states has its own specific rules and exemptions, so refer to your state's tax code or consult a tax professional to understand how your benefits might be affected.

What is the Social Security COLA?
The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is an important feature designed to help beneficiaries keep up with the rising cost of living. Each year, the Social Security Administration (SSA) evaluates the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to determine if a COLA is necessary. If the cost of living has increased, the SSA will adjust the benefits to reflect this change and help recipients maintain their purchasing power. This adjustment is particularly important for anyone who relies on Social Security as a primary source of income.

Who's eligible for Social Security COLAs?
COLA increases are automatically applied to all eligible beneficiaries, including those receiving retirement benefits, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. If you're currently receiving any of these types of Social Security benefits, you're automatically eligible for COLA increases when they're issued. The adjustment is typically announced in October and takes effect the following January. For example, if the CPI-W shows a significant increase, beneficiaries will see a corresponding rise in their monthly payments. This helps to mitigate the impact of inflation and seeks to ensure that the financial support provided by Social Security stays in line with recipients' real-life costs over time.

Social Security beneficiaries saw a 2.5% increase to their 2025 benefits through the most recent COLA. 

Tax-saving strategies for retirement
Social Security is often just one portion of your income in retirement. Planning ahead and coming up with a strategy for your different sources of income can help you minimize your overall tax liability. Consider taking advantage of tax-free withdrawals from Roth IRAs and timing required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans. Additionally, maximizing deductions and credits, such as the standard deduction or itemized deductions for medical expenses, can further reduce taxable income.

Roth conversions for tax efficiency
Roth conversions can have a significant impact on how much of your Social Security benefits are taxed. When you convert funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the amount converted is considered taxable income in the year of the conversion. This can temporarily increase your income, which might push you into a higher tax bracket or make more of your Social Security benefits taxable. However, the long-term benefits can sometimes outweigh the initial tax hit. Once the funds are in a Roth IRA, any growth is tax-free and you can withdraw them tax-free in retirement,1 which can help keep your overall tax liability lower in the future.

Is a Roth IRA conversion right for you?

When considering a Roth conversion, it's important to time it strategically. For example, if you expect your income to be lower in a particular year—perhaps due to a gap in employment or a year when you haven't started taking RMDs—it might be a good time to convert. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you navigate the complexities of a Roth conversion and ensure that the conversion aligns with your overall retirement and tax planning goals.

Managing taxable withdrawals
If you're looking to optimize your tax strategy in retirement, timing and the type of accounts you draw from can make a big difference in reducing your overall taxable income. One key strategy is to manage your RMDs wisely. RMDs are mandatory withdrawals that start at age 73, and they are taxable. To minimize the tax impact, consider taking only the minimum amount required each year, especially if you have other sources of income that can cover your living expenses.

Another effective approach is to employ a drawdown strategy that minimizes taxes. If you have both traditional and Roth IRAs, you can strategically withdraw from each to stay within a lower tax bracket. For instance, you might take just enough from your traditional IRA to stay below a certain tax threshold and then supplement with tax-free withdrawals from your Roth IRA. This can help you avoid jumping into a higher tax bracket and potentially reduce the amount of your Social Security benefits that are subject to taxes. Always consider consulting with a tax professional to create a strategy for your specific financial situation.

Investment strategies to lower retirement taxes
When planning for a tax-smart retirement, municipal bonds can be a great addition to your investment portfolio. These bonds, issued by state and local governments, offer interest payments that are typically exempt from federal income tax (and sometimes state and local taxes as well). This can be particularly beneficial if you live in a state with high tax rates. By investing in municipal bonds, you can earn income that helps cover your living expenses without increasing your taxable income as much as other types of investments might.

Another tax-smart investment to consider is a tax-managed mutual fund or ETF (exchange-traded fund). These funds are designed to minimize capital gains distributions, which can help keep your taxable income lower. Additionally, holding investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, can also be a smart move. By diversifying your investments and choosing tax-efficient options, you can create a more tax-friendly retirement income stream that helps you keep more of what you earn.

Depending on the types of investments you hold, and what earnings you receive from them, you'll need to consider the rules around paying taxes on your investment income.

Consider a financial advisor
Navigating the complexities of tax-efficient retirement planning can be overwhelming, but you don't have to go it alone. Working with a financial advice service can provide you with personalized guidance and help you explore a range of tax-efficient strategies to minimize your tax burden.

An advisor can help you understand the nuances of different investment options, like municipal bonds and tax-managed funds, and how they can fit into your overall financial plan. They can also assist you in timing your withdrawals from various accounts to stay within lower tax brackets and maximize your after-tax income. By leveraging their expertise, you can make informed decisions that align with your goals and help you feel more secure in your retirement plans.

retirement,3 ways to maximize your IRA contributions,"Did you know you can contribute to your IRA up to 15 months before the tax-filing deadline? Vanguard research shows that more investors are taking advantage of early contributions, but there are still quite a few who potentially pay the price for procrastinating.   

As you work to complete your 2024 taxes, it’s the perfect time to get a jumpstart on 2025 contributions—contribute to your IRA now instead of waiting until next year. Here are some tips gathered from insights into Vanguard investors’ contribution behavior over the past several years that show why this is a good practice:

1.     Contribute early to take advantage of compounding.
Although we’ve seen an increased trend of “early-bird” contributors (shown in the first graph below), there’s still a significant percentage of investors who wait until the next year to contribute. Many even hold off until April. Waiting can result in potentially paying a steep procrastination penalty by missing out on the power of compounding. As you can see in the second graph, that simple contribution timing decision can make a significant difference!

2.     Set up automatic contributions to benefit from tax-advantaged growth.
If you’re not able to contribute a lump sum early in the year, you can still participate in the tax-advantaged growth by contributing during the year through an automatic contribution program. For example, if you want to get to that $7,000 maximum for the 2025 tax year, consider establishing a $583 monthly contribution.

3.     Avoid decoupling contribution and investment decisions so contributions aren’t parked in cash.
Some investors seem to be focused on the act of getting their contribution in rather than making sure it’s invested; like it’s a check-the-box exercise. By decoupling the contribution and investment decisions they can end up leaving money sitting in cash for months before they invest it, thereby missing out on the potential returns that could have been generated. To avoid paying the potential opportunity cost of being uninvested, make sure to take that extra step when you contribute and consider investing right away in either a target date fund or balanced fund.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/maximize-your-ira-contributions,
retirement,Avoiding the “procrastination penalty”,"Points to know:

For each year, you can make IRA contributions from January 1 until the tax-filing deadline, which is typically April 15 of the following year.
The earlier you contribute, the sooner compounding can help your investments grow.
Some circumstances might prevent you from contributing; we discuss how to handle them.
Consider the earnings potential―not just for yourself but for your nonworking spouse.
A penny saved is a penny earned. So why not save sooner?
You have just over 15 months to make an IRA contribution for a particular tax year. For example, you have from January 1, 2024, through the tax-filing deadline of April 15, 2025, to contribute to your IRA for the 2024 tax year. It seems like plenty of time, but not all investors manage to take full advantage of the opportunity.

Only a small portion of investors make their contributions early, and many investors wait until the last possible moment to contribute. Although these contributions are applied before the deadline, you could be missing out if you wait.

Compounding: It's in your best interest
Why contribute early? Simple: compounding. When you make an initial investment, that money can generate its own earnings. If you reinvest that money, then both your investment and its earnings will generate additional earnings, offering you greater potential for growth.

The longer you wait to invest, the less time you have to reap the benefits of compounding. If you're 30 years away from retirement and wait until the last minute to contribute each year, that's even more missed potential over the course of 3 decades. We call this the ""procrastination penalty.""

The waiting game
Though it's referred to as the procrastination penalty, let's be clear: Not all individuals who wait to invest are procrastinating. Some may have specific challenges or concerns about their ability to contribute, like not being able to invest the full IRA maximum all at once. (For 2025, $7,000 annually, or $8,000 if you're 50 or older.) That's okay. You can start by contributing a smaller amount. You can also set up automatic investments by scheduling multiple contributions over the course of the year rather than investing a single lump sum. You can even set it up to maximize your contribution amount over the course of the year. That allows you to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging..

Or maybe you're waiting to contribute because you first need to determine your eligibility based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Depending on how much you earn in a given year, you may not be eligible to deduct the full amount of your traditional IRA contribution or make any contribution to a Roth IRA. Read more about Vanguard IRAs, including contribution limits, eligibility, and tax deductibility.

Make a plan
The earlier you invest, the earlier your IRA can start earning for you. Here are some ways to contribute:

Electronic bank transfer. You can link a personal bank account to your Vanguard IRA® and use it to make contributions.
Automatic investments. With automatic investments, you decide how much and how often to contribute. Or you can choose to maximize your IRA contribution to ensure you reach the annual limit allowed by the IRS.
Nonretirement account transfer. If you have an individual or joint account through Vanguard, you can transfer money to your IRA. You can also transfer assets from a nonretirement account at another company to your Vanguard IRA.
Nonworking spouses can save too
Making contributions to your IRA (and doing so early) is important. But did you know you can contribute to an IRA on behalf of a nonworking spouse? It's a great way to boost your retirement savings as a couple.

And if you or your spouse are 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions to save even more.

 

Take action today
The deadline to contribute to an IRA for the 2025 tax year is April 15, 2026, but you don't have to wait until then. Instead, invest earlier to help give your money more time to grow. It could help you potentially enjoy a more comfortable retirement.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/avoiding-the-procrastination-penalty,
retirement,"IRA contributions: The earlier, the better","In 2025, if you're under age 50, you can contribute up to $7,000 across one or more IRAs. If you're age 50 or older, the limit is slightly higher ($8,000).*

You can make an IRA contribution for a given year anytime between January 1 and the tax-filing deadline of the following year (usually April 15). So you can make a 2024 IRA contribution until April 15, 2025—but we don't recommend waiting. You can also make a 2025 IRA contribution between January 1, 2025, and April 15, 2026.

The point of investing
You invest to make money. The amount of money you make depends primarily on 3 factors:

Asset allocation. Bonds, stocks, and short-term cash reserves are all asset types. When you invest, you can choose what percentage of your total portfolio you want to allocate to each asset type. Depending on where you are in your investing journey, you may choose a more aggressive allocation (e.g., a higher percentage in stocks) or a lower-risk allocation (e.g., a higher percentage in bonds).
The amount you invest. You earn money through compounding—when your investment earnings generate their own earnings. If you contribute more, you have more money to generate earnings … which means you have more earnings to generate additional earnings. You can control the amount you invest as long as you stay within the annual IRA contribution limits. Learn about IRA eligibility, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules.
When you invest. If you wait until the tax deadline to make an IRA contribution, you'll miss out on more than 15 months of compounding. If you have the financial flexibility to choose when you contribute to your IRA, do it as soon as possible. Learn how time is related to risk and reward.  
Time is money
Using the 2025 contribution limit, let's say you invest $7,000 in your IRA every year for 30 years, and your average annual return is 4%.**

Example A: You make a lump-sum investment every January and your end balance is $392,595, which includes $182,053 in earnings.
Example B: You make a lump-sum investment every April and your end balance is $373,142, which includes $164,191 in earnings. That’s $19,453 less than you’d earn in Example A.
In each example, you're contributing a total of $210,000 to your IRA over the course of 30 years. The difference in earnings is due entirely to the timing of your contributions.

Do your best
The hypothetical examples above represent what-if scenarios that aren't always possible to replicate in real life. For instance, you may not be able to invest the same amount each year or you may have to skip some years altogether. That's okay. Take small steps toward saving 12%–15% of your gross income (including employer contributions) each year.

Maybe you don't have the financial flexibility to make a lump-sum investment in your IRA in January or April—or any other month, for that matter. That's okay too. Try setting up recurring automatic bank transfers. Making contributions twice a month over the course of 30 years (for a total contribution of $210,000) and earning a 4% average annual return would result in an end balance smaller than Example A but bigger than Example B. Not too shabby.

retirement,"Roth, traditional, or both?","Common ground
A traditional IRA allows you to contribute money that can grow tax-deferred. A Roth IRA holds after-tax money you can withdraw tax-free. They sound fundamentally different, but both are tax-advantaged accounts designed to help you save for retirement. They share other similarities too:

1. No age limit
You can contribute to both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA at any age as long as you're otherwise eligible. However, when you reach age 73,1 you'll be required to start taking annual distributions from your traditional IRA.

2.  Contribution limits
You typically need earned income to contribute to an IRA. For both traditional and Roth IRAs, the annual contribution limits for the 2024 tax year are $7,000 for those younger than 50 and $8,000 for those age 50 and older. The annual contribution limits for 2025 are $7,000 for those younger than 50 and $8,000 for those age 50 and older. 

These are total amounts across all your traditional and Roth IRAs; you can't contribute the maximum amount to each account separately. Depending on your income, your contribution limits may be lower. If you're married and your spouse earns low or no annual wages, they may be able to open a spousal IRA to boost your retirement savings as a couple.

3. Contribution deadline
Whether you're contributing to a traditional or a Roth, the deadline to contribute is the same for both accounts, and it's the tax-filing deadline for the tax year. For the 2024 tax year, the deadline is April 15, 2025. For the 2025 tax year, the deadline is April 15, 2026.

4. Transfer or rollover
You can transfer your IRA to another similarly registered IRA through a direct transfer. You can also withdraw money from your account for 60 days as long as you roll it back into the same or a similarly registered IRA. You can use this 60-day rollover option once every rolling 365 days. When you use the 60-day rollover option, taxes may be withheld from the withdrawal, so you'll have to use other funds to roll over the full amount of the distribution.

Learn the differences
To better understand the differences between Roth and traditional IRAs, let's focus on 3 areas: deductions, taxes, and withdrawals.

Traditional IRA
With a traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct your contributions  for the tax year in which you make them. Keep in mind that the deductible amount could be reduced or eliminated if you or your spouse are covered by an employer's retirement plan. When it's time to start withdrawing, your deductible contributions and earnings are taxed as ordinary income. If you don't qualify for deductible contributions, you can make a nondeductible contribution; the nondeductible portion won't be taxed upon withdrawal but the earnings will. Withdrawals work like this:

If you withdraw from your traditional IRA before you've reached age 59½, you'll pay ordinary income tax on the amount that represents the pre-tax portion of the distribution and a 10% early distribution penalty (unless an exception applies).
If you withdraw after you've reached 59½, you won't be penalized, but you'll still pay ordinary income tax on the amount that represents the pre-tax portion of the distribution.
When you reach age 73,1 you'll be required to start taking annual distributions from your traditional IRA. The amount you withdraw for your required minimum distribution (RMD ) is calculated based on your life expectancy and the balance of your account at the end of the previous year.
Roth IRA
Contributions you make to your Roth IRA aren't deductible. This means withdrawals of your Roth contributions (your ""basis"") will always come out tax- and penalty-free. You can also make tax-free withdrawals of your earnings as long as you've reached age 59½ and you've owned your Roth IRA for at least 5 years.2 There are no lifetime mandatory withdrawals for a Roth IRA because your contributions have already been taxed—meaning you can withdraw your savings at your leisure in retirement.

Eligibility
Any individual with earned income (or who has a spouse with earned income) can contribute to a traditional IRA. However, the amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA could be reduced—or even eliminated—based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI).

If you can't make the maximum Roth IRA contribution because your MAGI is over the upper limit of the annual income range, a Roth conversion may be right for you. This is when you take all or part of the balance of an existing traditional IRA and move it into a Roth IRA.

Summary
Whether you're eligible to contribute to a Roth, a traditional, or both, opening an IRA is a step toward a better retirement. Contributing as soon as you can gives your principal time to reap the benefits of compounding—where your investment earnings generate their own earnings. Your eligibility to contribute may depend on your income, so if you aren't sure what to do, reach out to a tax advisor to help you make an informed decision.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/roth-traditional-or-both,
retirement,Backdoor Roth IRA What it is and how to set it up,"""Backdoor Roth IRA"" is simply a term to describe a strategy used by high-income earners who can't contribute to a Roth IRA because their income is above certain limits. Rather than contribute directly to a Roth, you contribute to a traditional IRA, and then convert it to a Roth.

A Roth IRA is a popular retirement savings account to which you contribute after-tax dollars, and if you meet certain requirements, you can withdraw both the invested money (principal) and earnings accrued on the money tax-free in the future. You might be a good candidate if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire. The benefit of a Roth IRA is that it offers tax-free growth. 

Backdoor Roth IRA income limits
If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is above certain income limits, then the amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA is phased out. The phaseout occurs between $150,000 and $165,000 for single filers and $236,000 and $246,000 for joint filers in 2025. The backdoor method allows those with higher incomes who can't contribute in the typical manner to still take advantage of a Roth IRA.

How to set up a backdoor Roth IRA
There are 2 ways to set up a backdoor Roth IRA:
1. Contribute money to an IRA, and then roll over the money to a Roth IRA. For this strategy to work, you should contribute to a traditional IRA with no balance. If there's a balance in the IRA, there could be a taxable event when you convert. Once you contribute to the account and wait for any required holding period, you'll then convert the account to a Roth IRA. Any money earned due to market performance before the conversion takes place is subject to taxes. The contribution is considered nondeductible once you fill out IRS Form 8606 and complete your tax return. Note that there's no tax benefit for the year you establish a backdoor Roth IRA.

2. If your 401(k) plan allows, you may be able to do a mega backdoor Roth conversion. Some 401(k) plans permit automatic Roth conversions, which means you can make after-tax contributions and have them automatically convert to Roth within their accounts. Check with your plan to see if this option is available to you. 

When should you not consider this strategy?
A backdoor Roth IRA doesn’t make sense for everyone. If you're able to make a Roth IRA contribution the standard way, then you don't need to use the backdoor method.

If you have a balance in a rollover IRA and plan to contribute to that account, you may not want to make a backdoor Roth conversion because of the ""pro rata"" rule. This rule requires all IRA distributions to be taken proportionally from your pre-tax and after-tax contribution sources. This could limit the tax benefits you'd receive from a Roth conversion. For example, if you have a total of $1 million in IRA assets, and $100,000—or 10%—is after-tax money, then 10% of any withdrawal must be taken from after-tax money. For a $10,000 withdrawal, $1,000 would have to be after-tax money.

It's important to keep in mind when you plan to use the money. If you're looking to withdraw the money within 5 years, you may not receive all the Roth tax benefits.1 Also, when creating a backdoor Roth IRA, you'll have to work with an accountant to file tax forms to ensure you complete it accurately.

FAQs

What makes a backdoor Roth IRA different?
The difference is the way you make your contribution. High-income earners use the backdoor technique to establish a Roth IRA since they're unable to contribute in the standard way because of the Roth IRA income limits.

Do you pay taxes on backdoor Roth IRAs?
If you contribute money to an investment that accrues earnings before you complete the conversion, then you'll have to pay taxes on those earnings. Once the money is in a Roth IRA, your withdrawals will be tax-free if you meet certain requirements. If you're subject to the pro rata rule, your IRA distributions must be taken proportionally from your pre-tax and after-tax contribution sources.


Are backdoor Roth IRAs worth it?
You should consult with an advisor or tax professional to discuss your personal situation. It's best to sit down with an advisor who can help you determine if a backdoor Roth IRA would be beneficial to your situation.


How much can I contribute?
You can contribute up to $7,000 ($8,000 if age 50 and older) to a Roth IRA in 2025, if your income is below the phaseout amounts.


What are alternatives to backdoor Roth IRAs?
If your income is above the phaseout amount and you don't want to complete a backdoor Roth conversion, then your alternative is to invest in taxable accounts. They won't offer the same tax benefits but will give you an opportunity to diversify your investments. ",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/how-to-set-up-backdoor-ira,
retirement,Top three things retirement savers should consider,"Our industry over about the last 25 years has been making meaningful strides toward improving the prospects for a secure retirement for millions of Americans.

Retirement savers have benefited from innovations in 401(k) plan design, including autoenrollment, autoescalation, single-fund options, and Roth conversions. Vanguard has tracked the benefits of these advancements among our retirement plan participants and seen record-high participation and contribution rates, as well as a growing proportion of participants in target-date funds and advised solutions.

For those approaching retirement, financial wellness decisions such as when to retire, when to claim Social Security, and how to navigate health care choices and costs—including Medicare—can feel daunting. Financial education and personalized advice continue to be a wise option for many. But whatever your situation, National Retirement Security Week serves as a great reminder about three basic rules of thumb.

Three retirement rules of thumb…and more
Save 12%–15% of income for retirement
This is a good guideline, as this range represents both contributions and any employer match. If you’re saving more, that's great—keep it up. If you can, make sure you’re investing at least enough to get a company match. Start out by saving as much as you’re able and then increase the amount each year. Many employer-sponsored retirement plans offer an autoescalation feature that increases your savings rate yearly, usually by 1 to 2 percentage points.

Max out on tax-advantaged accounts
In addition to a 401(k) and other employer-sponsored retirement plans, you can contribute at least $7,000 annually to an individual retirement account. And IRA owners age 50 and older can make a catchup contribution of up to $1,000, for a total maximum contribution of $8,000 per year.1 Many investors don’t invest the maximum, and over a 30-year savings horizon, this potentially can mean lost savings in the tens of thousands of dollars.

It’s also important to decide which type of IRA—Roth or traditional—is best. For many young investors in particular, a Roth account is superior. Although Roth investors don’t get a tax deduction on their contributions, the many years of tax-free compounded growth will likely far outweigh the initial tax break that comes with traditional IRA contributions. But for older investors in their peak earning years, a traditional IRA might be a better option.

One also might consider a Health Savings Account (HSA) as an “off-label” retirement account. HSAs offer a triple tax advantage: Contributions may be 100% percent tax-deductible, all interest earned is tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free for eligible medical expenses (i.e., deductibles, copays, prescriptions, vision care, and dental care). So if you are in a high-deductible medical plan with an HSA, make full use of it. Ideally, if you can pay for current medical expenses out of pocket, your account can compound tax-free.

Don’t forget about asset allocation 
Choosing investments isn’t a one-size-fits-all decision. But certain broad principles apply to setting an asset allocation. People early in their career are investing to get to retirement, so they have a long time horizon. That’s a good thing, as they have plenty of time to ride out temporary downturns in account balances, as many of us have been experiencing in the current bear market. Simply put, a longer horizon means you may be able to afford to take more risk in hopes of getting higher returns.

Those closer to retirement have less time to wait for the market to bounce back. In this case, an asset mix with lower risk might be a better option. But be careful not to be too conservative. Investors should plan for a 30-year retirement horizon, so accounts need to keep growing so they can last long after a person leaves the workforce.

Regardless of age and risk tolerance, retirees should be concerned about at least keeping pace with the long-term effects of inflation, so it’s important to consider a healthy allocation to a globally diversified stock portfolio. Options range from customizing portfolios to taking advantage of professionally managed target-date or balanced funds.

Consider personalized financial advice
Retirement is clearly a top priority for most investors. But the reality is that most of us are juggling multiple savings goals. These may include paying for college or a home or budgeting for a secure lifestyle.

Working with a trusted financial professional can help investors make financial planning trade-offs when navigating household retirement decisions. For those approaching retirement, an advisor can help with some of the most challenging financial wellness decisions such as when to retire, when to claim Social Security, and how to navigate health care choices and costs, including Medicare.

So whether you knew about National Retirement Security Week, are in the midst of a participant education campaign, or just learned of the event, use it to make sure your retirement savings plan is in a good spot.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/top-three-things-retirement-savers-should-consider,
retirement,No 401(k) at work? Here's how you can save for retirement.,"If you have a 401(k) at work, saving for retirement can be fairly easy and straightforward.

But what if your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan? Or what if you’re self-employed? Fortunately, you have options to save for your retirement.

2 options designed for all investors
1.Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Both types of accounts offer long-term tax advantages. Anyone who has earned income can contribute up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you’re age 50 or older) for 2025 contributions.
2.You can also choose to save in a taxable account. While you won’t get any tax breaks, you’re still saving—and you don’t have income or contribution level limits.
 
3 options designed for self-employed investors
If you’re self-employed* and looking for other options, you might consider a SEP-IRA, a SIMPLE IRA, or an Individual 401(k). For all of these options, you’re the employer and the employee.

1.SEP-IRA. A SEP-IRA allows an employer to contribute to an employee’s account up to 25% of the employee’s compensation, up to $70,000 for the 2025 tax year. If you’re self-employed, you can make a maximum contribution of 20% of your net income reported on IRS Schedule C, minus the self-employment tax.**
A SEP-IRA is easy to set up, and you can even establish an account after the end of the calendar year—you only need to open and fund the account before the tax-filing deadline.

2. SIMPLE IRA. A SIMPLE IRA features both employee salary deferral contributions of up to $17,600 ($21,450 if you’re age 50 or older) for the 2025 tax year and an employer matching contribution of up to 3% of compensation.

A SIMPLE IRA is also easy to establish, but the deadlines are stricter. Generally, you must open a SIMPLE IRA by October 1 to contribute for the current tax year.

3. Individual 401(k). An Individual 401(k) could be a cost-effective and appropriate option for business owners with no employees (other than a spouse). They offer potentially higher contribution amounts and the flexibility to choose either pre-tax or Roth employee salary deferrals of up to $23,500 ($31,000 if you’re age 50 or older) for the 2025 tax year.

Employer contributions† are identical to the SEP-IRA (up to 25% of the employee’s compensation with a maximum of $70,000 for the 2025 tax year).

Save when you can
No matter what type of account you choose, you may want to consider investing more money when you’re earning more income to cover any future breaks in your employment. Of course, you’ll also want to check with a tax advisor to make sure you’re making an appropriate decision for your situation.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/no-401k-at-work-heres-how-you-can-save-for-retirement,
retirement,IRA deadlines: Why contributing early matters,"January brings a new tax year and new opportunities to benefit from the tax-advantaged compounding power of IRAs. In 2024, if you're under age 50, you can contribute up to $7,000 across one or more IRAs. If you're 50 or older, the limit is $8,000.1

IRA contribution deadlines
You can make an IRA contribution for a given year anytime between January 1 and the tax-filing deadline of the following year. You can make a 2024 IRA contribution until April 15, 2025. If you want to get a head start with your 2025 IRA contribution, you can make it as early as January 1, 2025. If you choose to wait to contribute, the deadline is April 15, 2026.

The point of investing
You invest to make money. The amount of money you make depends primarily on 3 factors:

1. When you invest. If you wait until the tax deadline to make an IRA contribution, you'll miss out on more than 15 months of compounding. If you have the financial flexibility to choose when you contribute to your IRA, do it as soon as possible. Learn how time is related to risk and reward

2. The amount you invest. One way you can earn money is through compounding—when your reinvested earnings generate their own earnings. If you contribute more, you have more money to generate earnings … which means you have more earnings to generate additional earnings. To maximize your contribution, you'll need to know about your eligibility and contribution limits. Learn about IRA eligibility, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules

3. Asset allocation. Bonds, stocks, and cash are all asset types. When you invest, you can choose what percentage of your total portfolio you want to allocate to each asset type. Depending on where you are in your investing journey, you may choose a more aggressive allocation (e.g., a higher percentage in stocks) or a lower-risk allocation (e.g., a higher percentage in bonds).

How much can an IRA grow?
The chart below shows the difference that contributing early can make over the course of 10, 20, and 30 years. The difference in earnings is based entirely on the timing of your contributions.

Make contributions a priority
The hypothetical examples above represent what-if scenarios not always possible to replicate in real life. For instance, you may not be able to invest the same amount each year or you may have to skip some years altogether. That's okay. Once you've determined an IRA is the appropriate savings vehicle, take small steps toward saving 12%–15% of your gross income for retirement (including any employer plan and matched contributions) each year. It's important to note that if you're 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions. If you're married, filing jointly, and have a nonworking spouse, they can make spousal contributions.

Maybe you don't have the financial flexibility to make a lump-sum investment in your IRA in January or April—or any other month, for that matter. That's okay too. Try setting up recurring automatic bank transfers. Making contributions twice a month over the course of 30 years (for a total contribution of $210,000) and earning a 6% average annual return2 would result in an end balance smaller than if you contributed $7,000 each January but larger than if you contributed $7,000 each April of the following year. Not too shabby.

If you're making an IRA contribution, no matter the amount and timing, you're on the right track.

retirement,Closing the gender gap in IRA balances,"There’s a gap between the median IRA balances of women and men, according to our research. A number of factors may hamper women’s ability to contribute,* but there are steps they can take to help narrow that gap.

Mind the (IRA) gap
The figure below shows that a gap exists between the median IRA balances of women and men across all generations, and that it is wider among older cohorts. While women’s IRA balances are at 98% of men’s at the median for Gen Z, women’s IRA balances are only 63% of men’s at the median for the baby boom generation.

There’s a gender gap in IRA balances, and it’s wider for older generations

Contribute early and often to narrow the gap
Contribution patterns in a sample of about 74,000 investors who opened IRAs at Vanguard from 2015 through 2022, about half of whom were women, illuminated how contribution differences may help explain the gender gap. Women typically opened their IRAs two years later than men and made contributions in five years over the eight-year sample period, whereas men typically contributed in six years.

While this may seem like a small difference, the power of compounding can add up, potentially making the gender divide even wider over time.

Women tend to open IRAs later and contribute less often compared with men

Don’t leave your rollovers uninvested
One way IRA investors may unknowingly falter, regardless of gender, is when rolling money into an IRA from another retirement plan, such as a 401(k). Funds rolled into an IRA are often put into a cash-like vehicle by default unless an investor picks funds to invest in when making the rollover, or their investments are brought over “in kind” from their retirement plan to their IRA.

Said another way: An allocation from another retirement plan does not automatically carry over into an IRA. If rollover funds are not invested, an investor can’t capitalize on long-term market returns.

Our research shows that a larger proportion of women leave rollover funds uninvested compared with men, as illustrated in the figure below. On average, 56% of women who make an IRA rollover miss out on one year of market returns by leaving funds uninvested (compared with 44% of men), and 33% miss out on seven years of returns (compared with 23% of men).

However, when women do invest, they tend to build well-diversified portfolios to meet their financial goals. Our data as of December 31, 2022, show that about 44% of women with IRAs were using professionally managed allocations, either by holding a target-date fund or a balanced fund or by enrolling in an advice service, compared with about 40% of men. 

When rolling money over into an IRA, women are more likely than men to leave it uninvested

Small changes can lead to better outcomes for women with IRAs
While any number of factors may contribute to some women opening IRAs later and contributing less frequently than men, for those in a position to do so, some small changes may help close the gap. In the meantime, our research shows that gap is already narrowing among younger generations such as Gen Z and millennials.

For any women thinking about opening an IRA or unsure if you've invested your rollover funds, consider putting time on your side by investing in yourself: Open an account, contribute to it early and often, and, if you make a rollover, be sure to select funds to invest in.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/closing-the-gender-gap-in-ira-balances,
retirement,Things to consider before retiring,"What retirement looks like is unique to you.

Achieving a happy retirement is as much about your purpose—what you want to do and where you want to do it—as your portfolio.

73% of workers expect to keep working in retirement
Consider these 3 questions before you retire
1. How should I spend my time?
When planning your retirement, it's important to remember that certain aspects of your life will change. For many people, work provides not only a steady income but also your social connections, purpose and goals, and mental stimulation. Losing access to those connections and benefits in retirement can be a challenge, but here are some ways to keep yourself connected and engaged:

Give back. Volunteering can be a meaningful way to spend your time. You can help others by using the skills you developed during your career, or even learn new ones.
Stay active. Poor health can derail the best-laid plans. Look for ways to build exercise into your postretirement days, as well as activities to keep your mind sharp.
Take classes. Retirement is a great time to finish your degree or simply learn something new. You can also choose from hundreds of online courses, some of which are free.
Start traveling. Maybe you'd like to do some cross-country RVing or are dreaming of a future international trip. Just keep in mind that traveling can be expensive. Make sure your anticipated retirement income aligns with your goals.
Be social. Much of what retirees miss about work is the relationships they've built. Make a plan to maintain your current relationships and build new ones.
Keep working. The 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey found that 73% of workers expected to do some type of paid work in retirement.1 Although the continued income is an incentive, you may choose to keep working because you enjoy the routine of it. Keep in mind that the job market is always changing, and it may hard to predict what jobs are available.
Avoid these pitfalls if you keep working
Even if you decide to keep working, you shouldn't put off certain retirement decisions. Avoid these missteps so they don't end up eating into your earned income:

Taking Social Security early and having part of your payment withheld.
Missing out on making additional IRA and retirement plan contributions.
Neglecting opportunities to complete Roth IRA conversions.
Not taking your required minimum distributions (RMDs).
Underestimating your taxes.
Neglecting to enroll in Medicare.
Triggering Medicare surcharges.
Failing to factor in health care costs.
Vanguard's Tax-Efficient Retirement Strategy can help guide you through your options for when to draw Social Security, and which accounts to withdraw from.

2. Where should I live?
Once you have an idea of what you want to do in retirement, the where may become clearer.

Here are a few options to consider:

Staying put. According to AARP, roughly 75% of people age 50+ want to remain in their current home.2 One reason to age in place is the cost savings if your home is paid off. However, you'll still need to plan on covering maintenance expenses, property taxes, and renovations or modification costs.
Moving away. You may want to consider living in another part of the country. Some states are more retirement-friendly than others, offering a lower cost of living, better access to health care, lower taxes, and more.
Going smaller. Downsizing is an attractive option if you want less to maintain. You could also realize a profit from selling your home and then reinvest that money back into your retirement savings. Just remember to account for any moving expenses.
Joining a community. If you're social and like to participate in organized activities, a retirement community might be right for you. And if you're concerned about how you'll cope as you age, try finding a community with graduated care services. Be aware that these communities often charge hefty up-front fees in addition to your monthly living expenses.
3. When should I retire?
Once you've figured out what you want to do and where you want to live, you also need to decide when you're officially going to retire.

Assuming you have—or will have—the money you'll need, here are a couple of other things to consider in determining when to retire.

Taking early retirement
Generally, an early retirement means retiring before the ages you'd qualify for Social Security or Medicare—62 and 65, respectively. If you have a plan for what you'll do with those extra nonworking years, the main thing to consider is whether you'll likely need to save more money.

Another important consideration in your retirement planning strategy is when to start taking Social Security. If you have income sources to fund the first few years of retirement, postponing your Social Security benefits can be profitable. Each year you delay retirement (until age 70), your Social Security benefits will increase by 8%, making it appealing to delay taking the benefit if possible.3 However, it's important to consider how other planning strategies in retirement could be affected by this decision.

Retiring earlier gives you less time to accumulate assets and means you'll be drawing on those assets longer. Once you've put together a reasonable retirement budget, you may want to test it out for a year or so. That way you can make any adjustments while you're still bringing in a paycheck.

If you're thinking of retiring early, consider meeting with an advisor so they can help you come up with a plan to make that happen. If you have a spouse or partner, you'll want to include them in your discussions and plans as well.

Retiring together or separately
If you're planning for retirement with a spouse or partner, it's good to think through different scenarios. Although you may picture retiring together, it might not be what works best for you both. You'll need to consider your ages, your individual jobs and incomes, and your ideas of what retirement will look like.

It's important to get on the same page well before it's time to start that next chapter. By working together, you can come up with a plan intended to maximize your monthly income benefit while still meeting your immediate spending needs.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/things-to-consider-before-retiring,
retirement,6 factors affecting your retirement health care costs,"How to predict and prepare

Have you included your expected health care expenses in your retirement plan?

Average health care costs, even with Medicare, could surpass $5,000 per year, according to a model we developed in partnership with Mercer Health & Benefits.1 And although costs vary substantially from person to person, it's possible to estimate what yours might be—and then plan for them.

As an advisor, I collaborate with my clients and educate them as they move closer to and through retirement. The more we plan, the more they feel at ease when it comes time to retire.

3x as many investors report having peace of mind because of their advisor.

How much money you'll need for health care may be the biggest unknown expense you'll have in retirement—and how you prepare could determine how long your savings last.

So what comprises the model that drives our personalized estimates? Many factors affect health care expenses, but according to our research, these are the 6 most important.

1. Medicare choice
When it's time for you to enroll in Medicare (at age 65), carefully review the available plans and choose one that's right for you based on your individual needs.

Costs vary based on coverage. When considering your options, think about whether you'd prefer to pay higher premiums (and additional premiums for extra policies) to increase the predictability of your out-of-pocket costs. You'll reenroll each year around the same time, so you'll be able to reevaluate your plan and choose a different option to address your evolving needs.

If you need guidance around your Medicare decision, getting in touch with our advisors is a great start. They have several resources that can help you narrow your plan selection based on your priorities.

2. Health status
How healthy you are when you enter retirement and your family health history largely determine the Medicare coverage you'll need and how much you can expect to spend on health care.

A few questions to consider:

Do you smoke?
Do you have an unhealthy diet?
Do you refrain from exercise? 
Do you visit the doctor often (at least 10 times a year)?
Do you have 2 or more chronic health conditions?
If you answered ""yes"" to at least 1 question, you should plan to spend more of your retirement income on health care. Keep in mind, however, that a higher health risk can also increase the likelihood you'll need long-term care. Fortunately, many retirees don't end up needing it, but if you do, it can be expensive. You may want to build long-term care into your plan as a separate cost.

An advisor can help you determine when to start planning for long-term care. There are risks to planning too late—but also too early. We can help you set an ideal time frame based on your personal circumstances. My goal for my clients is for them to feel confident and in control of their financial destiny. For some, this may include a long-term care insurance plan. For others, a separate investment account may make sense.

3. Retirement age
Some of my clients have a goal to retire early. With unpredictable economic factors such as inflation and market volatility, knowing how much to save can be difficult. As an advisor, I use financial planning tools to examine considerations related to my clients' retirement options, such as Social Security, tax-efficient withdrawals, and health care saving contributions. This helps ensure they're saving enough to cover their health care expenses during those gap years before they're eligible for Medicare.

To determine how much they should save, we discuss their health care coverage plans.

One possibility is to stay on your spouse's employer-sponsored plan if your spouse is still working. You could also remain on your employer's plan through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), which allows workers and their families to continue health benefits under their group plan.2 However, COBRA costs more than what most employees pay for health care before they retire. Additionally, COBRA usually only lasts for 18 months, so if you retire before you're eligible for Medicare, you may have to use a combination of different health care sources.

If an employer-sponsored plan isn't a possibility, you can buy insurance through the federal marketplace or purchase private insurance. All these options have their own requirements, and their costs vary, so you'll want to research to see what makes sense for you.

And since asset location and tax-loss harvesting can help lower a person's modified adjusted gross income, you might qualify for cost-lowering health care subsidies like those under the Affordable Care Act.  

My goal for my clients is for them to feel confident and in control of their financial destiny. For some, this may include a long-term care insurance plan. For others, a separate investment account may make sense.

—Mark Vandenburg, CFP®, Senior Financial Advisor

4. Employer subsidy
If you've had coverage through an employer-sponsored plan—either yours or your spouse's—your health care costs in retirement can seem even higher. Research shows that when a worker retires, they lose an average of $6,440 in employer subsidies.3 If that's the case for you or your spouse, you might need to bridge that gap with other funding.

A Health Savings Account (HSA) may help. If you have an HSA, you can use the money you withdraw for medical expenses—or pay out of pocket from your retirement savings. The decision is yours.

5. Location
Where you live in retirement also affects your health care costs. Although traditional Medicare coverage costs the same everywhere, other expenses such as prescription coverage, supplemental plans, and private insurance can vary from state to state and even region to region within the same state.

6. Income in retirement
If you plan on working after enrolling in Medicare or earn substantial income from your retirement savings, the government may not subsidize as much of your health care costs—it depends on your total income. The income levels you'll need to exceed to trigger surcharges are high, however—$103,000 for individuals and $206,000 for married couples in 2024.4

What to consider when you pick a Medicare plan
When researching available plans, think about what each offers and how they match your needs:

Look for a plan with more coverage if you have health issues.
Know the details of each plan's deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket costs.
Find out if your preferred providers or network accepts the plan you want to choose.­
Consider a plan with foreign travel benefits if your retirement will include international travel.
Determine how your chosen plan will work with any employer-sponsored coverage you might still have.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/6-factors-affecting-your-retirement-health-care-costs,
retirement,The case for moving cash out of retirement accounts,"Having cash investments—like money market funds, savings accounts, and CDs (certificates of deposit)—in your retirement account may not be as beneficial as you might think. It's a good idea to have them available for short-term goals—like emergency savings or an upcoming vacation—because they're low risk and highly liquid. But for long-term goals—like retirement—they lack the earning potential of other asset classes, such as stocks and bonds.

Moving out of cash positions today may help you build more retirement savings for tomorrow. Here's why.

Increase earning potential with a diversified portfolio
When inflation goes up, things become more expensive, and cash loses its purchasing power. Cash investments may result in lower returns—so you run the risk of not meeting your goals. Instead, investing in a portfolio of different asset classes—like stocks and bonds—can help you keep up with inflation by earning more on your savings.

While investing in stocks and bonds can increase your risk, they have a higher potential for returns when compared with cash investments. Figure 1 shows the potential returns from investing in different asset classes. While investing in the stock market is riskier than investing in money market funds, it can lead to higher returns. So while you may think you're playing it safe by being in cash positions, you may be missing out on returns over the long term.

Because it's difficult to predict which investments will perform well, diversifying across asset classes in both domestic and international markets can help shield you from unnecessarily large losses when inevitable market downturns occur. If one company or sub-asset class is underperforming, you'll have other investments to help balance out the ups and downs. Remember, the higher the risk, the (potentially) higher the reward. Taking measured risks you're comfortable with can help you see returns in your portfolio. Figure 2 shows how varying stock and bond allocations may result in different returns.

Investing today can go a long way
The more time you have until retirement, the more you may benefit from the power of compounding. Your future returns build on previous ones, and these ""earnings on earnings"" can grow to be as large as or even larger than your initial investments, as long as you reinvest any dividends and income distributions.

retirement,Top Social Security questions,"For most Americans, Social Security represents a significant source of retirement income. In fact, the Social Security Administration (SSA) reports that Social Security benefits make up about 30% of retirees' income.1

Being strategic about taking Social Security can help you optimize future payments and feel a greater sense of control over your finances.

To collect, you need to be 62 or older and have paid into Social Security through your payroll deductions for a minimum of 10 years.

But just because you can collect payments immediately doesn't mean you should. Your personal strategy to get the most out of Social Security should depend on many factors, which I'll discuss later.

How much Social Security will I receive?
Your beneﬁts are based on the payroll taxes you and your employers pay. Those taxes come out of your earnings, so the higher your earnings, the greater your beneﬁts.

Even for top earners, however, the beneﬁts are relatively moderate. The maximum Social Security beneﬁt at full retirement age in 2024 is $3,822 per month.1 Full retirement age is based on your birth date. For example, if you were born in or after 1960, your full retirement age is 67.

I recommend my clients get an estimate of their beneﬁts long before they apply for them so we can start to plan how to maximize them.


How much can I earn while on Social Security?
Once you've reached full retirement age, you can earn as much as you want with no penalties.

Before your full retirement age, you can earn up to $22,320 per year (as of 2024) without having your Social Security payments reduced. Bad news: If you earn over this limit, your beneﬁts will be cut. Good news: When you reach full retirement age, any withheld beneﬁts will be returned to you in the form of higher monthly payments.

If you're within the calendar year when you'll achieve full retirement age but haven't reached your birthday month yet, the earnings limit is much higher: $59,520 for 2024.

Factors that can affect your strategy
You should carefully consider the following factors to decide your best Social Security strategy:


Your health status
How many years do you think you'll collect benefits?


Your savings
Can you spend from savings while letting your benefits continue to increase?


Your marital status
Can you claim benefits under your spouse's or former spouse's earnings?


Other retirement income
What other sources of guaranteed, cost-of-living adjusted income will you have?


Your retirement age
How long do you plan to work and how much will you earn?

The Tax-Efficient Retirement Strategy is an exciting new retirement planning tool I can use to help optimize your Social Security benefits.3  It analyzes thousands of detailed financial projections to bring you a cohesive strategy for when to claim Social Security, as well as 2 other complex retirement decisions: whether you should take advantage of Roth conversions and which withdrawal order can help minimize your taxes so you can better meet your spending and legacy goals. Your recommended Social Security strategy considers various factors, including life expectancy outcomes, to help determine the optimal time for you and your spouse to begin collecting Social Security to maximize your lifetime benefit. 

How can I increase my Social Security benefits?
The easiest way to increase your monthly payments is to delay collecting. You won't get 100% of your beneﬁts unless you wait until your full retirement age to claim. After your full retirement age, your beneﬁts will keep increasing by 8% a year for each year you wait until you turn 70.

But there are other potential ways to increase your beneﬁts as well.

If you're married. You and your spouse should coordinate your claims to maximize the beneﬁts. Whether you claim at the same time or use a split strategy to claim at diﬀerent ages, it usually makes sense for the higher earner to wait longer to collect. Over time, the higher earner's increases will be worth more.

If you're divorced and haven't remarried. You may be eligible to claim beneﬁts on your ex's earnings record if you were married for at least 10 years.

If you're a surviving spouse. You can claim survivor beneﬁts as early as age 60 if your spouse's earnings qualiﬁed them for Social Security. You also have the option to switch to your own beneﬁts when you reach age 62 or older, if that strategy makes sense for you.

If you've started taking Social Security before full retirement age. Maybe you realized you'd be better oﬀ letting the beneﬁt continue to grow. Or perhaps you decided to return to work or don't need the money for another reason. Here are 2 ways you can undo your decision, to some extent:

Withdraw your application and pay back what you received. You can do this if it's been less than a year since you ﬁled for beneﬁts.
Suspend your benefits once you've reached full retirement age. This is your option if it's been over a year since you ﬁled. Your beneﬁt amount will increase every year until you turn 70 or start to collect again.
Some of these strategies can be complicated and some—like withdrawing your application—can only be done once, so you want to make sure you get them right. A ﬁnancial advisor can run diﬀerent scenarios to help you understand the potential implications.

Here's more information to help you maximize your Social Security beneﬁts.

What else affects my Social Security payments?
While you're strategizing ways to increase your beneﬁts, keep in mind these things that can decrease them:


Taxes. Retirees with moderate or higher incomes will likely end up paying federal tax on some portion of their beneﬁts. According to the SSA, about 40% of people who receive beneﬁts pay taxes on them.1 And some states tax Social Security beneﬁts too.


Medicare deductions. If you're claiming Social Security and apply for traditional Medicare, the premiums from Medicare Part B will be deducted from your Social Security payments.


Certain pensions. If you received a pension from a government entity or another organization that didn't withhold Social Security taxes, your beneﬁts could be reduced. This could also aﬀect any spousal beneﬁts you might claim.

Earnings if you keep working. Depending on your age, if you're working and also collecting Social Security, your beneﬁts can be decreased if your earnings exceed the set limits.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/top-social-security-questions,
retirement,Getting to a complete retirement plan,"How should I spend my time?
When planning what your retirement life will be like, it's important to remember that certain aspects of your working life will no longer apply. For most retirees, that's not only a steady income—it can also be your social connections, purpose and goals, and mental stimulation.

With that in mind, here are some ways to keep yourself connected and engaged:

Give back. Volunteering can be a meaningful way to spend your time. You can help others by using the skills you developed during your career, or even learn new ones.
Stay active. Poor health can derail the best-laid plans. Look for ways to build exercise into your postretirement days, as well as activities to keep your mind sharp.
Take classes. Retirement is a great time to finish your degree or simply learn something new. You can also choose from hundreds of online courses, some of which are free.
Start traveling. Maybe you'd like to do some cross-country RVing or are dreaming of a future international trip. Just keep in mind that traveling can be expensive. Make sure your anticipated retirement income aligns with your goals.
Be social. Much of what retirees miss about work is the relationships they've built. So make a plan for maintaining your current relationships and building new ones.
Keep working. The 2022 Retirement Confidence Survey found that 70% of workers expected to do some type of paid work in retirement. Although the continued income is an incentive, you may choose to keep working because you enjoy the routine of it.
Avoid these pitfalls if you keep working
Even if you decide to keep working, you shouldn't put off certain retirement decisions. Avoid these missteps so they don't end up eating into your income:

Taking Social Security early and having part of your payment withheld.
Not taking your required minimum distributions (RMDs).
Underestimating your taxes.
Neglecting to enroll in Medicare.
Triggering Medicare surcharges.
Missing out on making additional IRA and retirement plan contributions.
Failing to factor in health care costs.
Missing opportunities to complete Roth IRA conversions.

Where should I live?
Once you have an idea of what you want to do in retirement, the where may become clearer.

Here are a few options to consider:

Staying put. According to AARP, 75% of people age 50+ want to remain in their current home. One reason to stay is the cost savings if your home is paid off.

However, you'll still need to plan on covering maintenance expenses, property taxes, and modification costs.
Moving away. You may want to consider living in another part of the country. Some states are more retirement-friendly than others, offering a lower cost of living, better access to health care, lower taxes, and more.
Going smaller. Downsizing is an attractive option if you want less to maintain. You could also realize a profit from selling your home and then reinvest those dollars back into your retirement savings. Just remember to account for any moving­-related expenses.
Joining a community. If you're social and like to participate in organized activities, a retirement community might be right for you. And if you're concerned about how you'II cope as you age, try finding a community with graduated care services. Just be aware that these communities often charge hefty up-front fees in addition to your monthly living expenses.
When should I retire?
Once you've figured out what you want to do and where, you also need to decide on the when.

See when you can retire

Assuming you have or will have the money you'll need, here are a couple of other things to consider in determining when to retire.

Taking early retirement
Generally, this means retiring before the ages you'd qualify for Social Security or Medicare—62 and 65, respectively. If you have a plan for what you'll do with those extra nonworking years, the main thing to consider is that you'll most likely need to save more.

When to start taking Social Security can also play a role in your retirement planning strategy. If you have income sources to fund the beginning years of retirement, Social Security grows at a significant rate (8% per year), making it appealing to delay taking the benefit if possible.

Retiring earlier gives you less time to accumulate assets and means you'll be drawing on those assets longer. Once you've put together a reasonable retirement budget, you may want to test it out for a year or so. That way you can make any adjustments while you're still bringing in a paycheck.

If you're thinking of retiring early, it would be wise to meet with an advisor sooner rather than later so they can help you figure out how best to make it happen. If you have a spouse or partner, you'll want to discuss this plan with them as well.

Retiring together or separately
If you're planning for retirement with a spouse or partner, it's good to think through different scenarios of how it could play out. Although you may picture retiring together, it may not be what works best for you both. You'll need to consider your ages, your individual jobs and incomes, and your ideas of what retirement will look like.

It's important to get on the same page well before it's time to start that next chapter. But by working together, you can come up with a plan intended to maximize your monthly income benefit while still meeting your immediate spending needs.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/getting-to-a-complete-retirement-plan,
retirement,Required Minimum Distributions,"What are RMDs?
Once you turn age 73,1 you must withdraw a minimum amount—known as your RMD—each year from your tax-deferred retirement savings accounts like traditional IRAs. You may also need to take your RMD from any qualified employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s.

What's the deadline for taking an RMD?
The Secure 2.0 Act raised the age at which account owners must begin taking RMDs. If you're older than 73, you must take your RMD by December 31 each year. But if you're turning 73 this year, you have until April 1 of next year to take your first RMD.1 For each subsequent year, you must take your RMD by December 31. Keep in mind that if you delay your initial RMD until April 1, you'll be responsible for 2 withdrawals that year—one by April 1 and one by December 31. This could result in a larger tax liability.

It's very important to withdraw your RMD on an annual basis. If you forget, you'll face a penalty tax on any RMD amount not withdrawn.


Which retirement accounts require minimum distributions?
RMD rules apply to all employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and 457(b) plans. They also apply to traditional IRAs, SEPs, SARSEPs, and SIMPLE IRAs.

Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA owners don't need to take RMDs. However, beneficiaries who inherit them could still have an annual RMD obligation. This requirement can vary based on several factors like the final age of the original owner and the number of beneficiaries.

How are RMDs calculated?
Calculating RMD amounts can get a bit complicated, which is why we recommend leaving it to the experts. But here's a high-level overview of how it works.

RMD amounts are determined by the following factors:

Your age as of December 31 of the current year and your corresponding life expectancy factor according to the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table or the Joint Life and Last Survivor Table if your spouse is your sole beneficiary and more than 10 years younger than you.
Your retirement account balance as of December 31 of the previous year, which should be adjusted to include any outstanding rollovers or asset transfers that weren't in the account at the end of the year. 
Note: In this situation, you'll need to call Vanguard to confirm the value of the outstanding rollover assets that need to be included in your December 31 balance.
For example, if the life expectancy factor for your age is 22.9, and the value of your IRA is $800,000, your RMD would be $34,934.50 ($800,000/22.9).

What if I don't take my RMD or don't distribute enough to satisfy the requirement?
Depending on the amount you're required to take, the cost of missing an RMD can be significant—so it's best to take the full amount each year. Updates to the Secure 2.0 Act made in 2023 reduced the tax penalty from 50% to 25%—and possibly 10% if you correct your RMD within 2 years. For RMD amounts that were required to be withdrawn for the 2022 tax year, you may still be subject to a 50% tax penalty. Speak to your tax advisor for more information.

Can I take my RMD from multiple retirement accounts?
You should calculate your RMD separately for each IRA or 403(b) you own, but you can withdraw the total amount from one or more of your IRAs or 403(b)s. However, required distributions from 401(k) and 457(b) plans must be taken separately from each of these plan accounts.


How will my RMDs be taxed and how can I plan for it?
Distributions of contributions and earnings from a traditional IRA are fully taxable as ordinary income. You're eligible to withdraw from a traditional IRA penalty-free if you're 59½. However, if you're taking distributions from an IRA that was partially or fully funded with after-tax contributions, some or all of your RMD may be exempt from taxes. Use IRS Form 8606 to calculate and report the exempt portion. You can withdraw Roth IRA earnings tax- and penalty-free when you turn 59½ if you've also held the account for 5 years.

When you're between the ages of 59½ and 73, you have the flexibility to annually revisit how to minimize your future taxes. For example, if you have a large balance in a tax-deferred account—like a traditional IRA or 401(k)—and could face high RMDs in the future, you may benefit from:

Withdrawing those assets in the years leading up to your RMD age. While you'll be accelerating some tax liability up front, you'll be decreasing future RMDs thanks to a smaller account balance.
Converting some of your traditional IRA assets into a Roth IRA, which—if you've held the account for at least 5 years—isn't currently subject to RMDs or taxes when you withdraw your assets in retirement. Learn more about the benefits of a Roth conversion to see if it might be a smart move for you.

What if I don't need the RMD assets?
RMDs are designed to spread your retirement savings and related taxes over your lifetime. If you don't depend on the money to satisfy your spending needs, you may want to consider:

Reinvesting your distributions in a taxable account to take advantage of continued growth. You can then add beneficiaries to that account without passing along future RMDs to them.
Gifting to a qualified charity. You can gift up to $108,000 in 2025 (up from $105,000 in 2024). Generally, qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs, aren't subject to ordinary federal income taxes. As a result, they're excluded from your taxable income.  
Beginning in 2023, a QCD may be taken to fund a charitable remainder unitrust, charitable remainder annuity trust, or charitable gift annuity up to a maximum onetime amount of $53,000.
What else should I consider before taking my RMD?
Several years may have passed since you first named IRA beneficiaries, and your designations may need to be updated due to marriage, divorce, births, or deaths. You can review and update your beneficiary designations for your Vanguard accounts online.

If your sole primary beneficiary is your spouse, and they're more than 10  years younger than you, you'll use a different life expectancy table and probably take a smaller distribution. It's also a good idea to review and understand RMD rules for inherited IRAs.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/retirement/what-are-rmds,
retirement,8 key benefits of a Roth IRA,"What is a Roth IRA and why should you consider one?
At a glance:

A Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement account that’s funded with after-tax money. Roths offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. However, there are many considerations and benefits to a Roth, including eligibility. 

A Roth IRA can offer versatility and tax-efficiency when saving for retirement. If you don’t have a Roth IRA, here are 8 reasons to consider opening one today:

1. You get tax-free growth
One of the benefits of a Roth IRA is that the money you invest in a Roth IRA grows tax-free, so you don’t have to worry about reporting investment earnings—the money your money makes—when you file your taxes. By comparison, if you invest in a nonretirement account, your earnings are subject to federal, state, and local taxes each year.

2. You can take tax-free withdrawals in retirement
If you’re age 59½ or older and have owned your account for at least 5 years,1 you can withdraw money—contributions plus earnings—from your Roth IRA without paying any penalties or taxes.
So even if you take a lump-sum withdrawal in retirement, your retirement income won’t be affected. This is a valuable benefit because your income affects how much you pay in taxes—including the taxation of Social Security benefits—as well as Medicare Parts B and D premiums.

3. You decide when, if, and how to take withdrawals
Unlike a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA has no lifetime required minimum distribution. You’re eligible for tax-free and penalty-free early withdrawals on what you’ve contributed at any time. But, if you’re under age 59½ and you withdraw earnings on your contributions, you may be subject to taxes and withdrawal penalties on that amount. It's smart to contribute to your Roth IRA and let compounding—when your contributions generate returns—work its magic. But if you need to take distributions from your Roth IRA, that's okay too.

Even if you withdraw your contributions, that money generated earnings while it was invested in your account. And those earnings will be yours to withdraw (also free and clear) when you're retired. However, you'll still be subject to IRA annual contribution limits, so you can't ""replace"" the money you withdrew and contribute the maximum amount to your IRA in the same contribution year.

4. You may qualify for additional tax credits
Investors who make eligible contributions to an employer-sponsored 401(k), Roth IRA, or other retirement fund, may qualify for the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit, or Saver’s Credit. Eligibility depends on a number of factors, including your adjusted gross income and how much you’ve contributed to your Roth IRA or other retirement plan.

Find out if you're on track for your retirement needs.

5. You may be eligible for a “backdoor Roth IRA” conversion

If your income is too high for a Roth IRA, you could get into a Roth through the “back door.”

To use this strategy, you’d make non-tax deductible contributions to a traditional IRA—which has no income limits. Then you’d move that money into a Roth IRA using a Roth conversion. You may want to consult you financial advisor and tax professional to understand the tax consequences before making a move because a Roth conversion is permanent.

6. Your beneficiaries won’t be taxed
The people who inherit your Roth IRA—your beneficiaries—will have to take RMDs (required minimum distributions), but they won’t have to pay any federal income tax on their withdrawals as long as the account’s been open for at least 5 years. We can help guide you through the process, but seek the advice of your financial advisor if you have any questions.

7. You may be eligible to invest in both a Roth IRA and a 401(k)
You don’t have to think IRA versus 401(k). You may be eligible to contribute to both, as long as you’re qualified and heed the contribution and income limits. Combining these plans may set you up for more wealth in retirement, and that’s good news.

8. Choose from a wide variety of investment options
Another benefit of a Roth IRA is that you have lots of investment choices. For example, at Vanguard, you can choose from our broad range of low-cost mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds), as well as individual stocks and bonds and funds from other companies.

retirement,3 behavioral factors can affect retirement spending,"3 factors that can affect spending
1. Self-control
When it comes to saving, investors tend to take either a shortsighted or a farsighted approach.

Shortsighted investors generally give more weight to spending and overindulging in the present. As a result, they fail to save enough for retirement. On the other hand, farsighted investors exercise a great deal of self-control when it comes to saving, and they tend to insufficiently indulge themselves. Their discipline generally leaves them more than prepared for retirement. However, unlike their myopic counterparts who may regret their indulgences later, farsighted investors tend to feel a sense of regret for exercising too much self-control and not spending more on life's pleasures.

Transitioning to the decumulation phase can be a tricky time, even if you're in a position where you can afford to spend more than you are. After all, the very personality features that led you to diligently save for more than 40 years don't just go away with the flip of a switch when it's time to draw down your assets.

To help my clients shift from a saving to a spending mindset, I take time to understand their concerns and offer customized solutions to meet their needs.

For example, most clients don't just go from making few to no withdrawals to buying that Lamborghini they've always dreamed of. I work with them to illustrate how splurging on a particular item will affect their financial future. And often times, we find that there's no impact to their long-term financial success. Our conversations also consider the following questions:

Why did you save for retirement in the first place and what do you truly value in life? Maybe comfort, security, personal growth, and quality time with loved ones are important to you. Remember, you worked hard to save for your unique goals. Spending in retirement can help you realize them.

How will you feel in the future if you don't live in the moment or enjoy spending what you can afford to now? When the idea of spending induces anxiety, focusing on how you'll feel later may make your decision to go on that family trip, for example, a little easier. This is especially true if building lasting family memories in your retirement is one of the reasons you saved so hard in the first place.

2. Loss aversion
It's natural to feel good about accumulating money and bad about losing it. The principles behind loss aversion explain why the negative feelings of losing money are greater than the positive feelings of gaining an equivalent amount of money.

Loss aversion also implies that it's less upsetting to incur losses all at once than to incur them across multiple occasions. Simply put, it hurts less to lose $100 at once, than to lose $25 on 4 separate occasions. For these reasons, coupled with the personal attachment investors have toward their savings, it shouldn't come as a surprise that some people experience feelings of constant loss when making retirement withdrawals.

Here are a couple of strategies I use when working with my clients to help reduce those feelings of loss:

Change your mindset. Consider your monthly or annual withdrawals as paychecks to yourself instead of money you're taking away from your savings.
Consider taking larger distributions less frequently. This is a simple tactic that works for many of my clients. Instead of taking smaller monthly withdrawals, they draw down larger amounts on a quarterly, biannual, or annual basis and set it aside in a separate spending account.
3. Scarcity and opportunity costs
Spending from what seems to be a fixed pool of nonreplenishing resources can elicit feelings of stress and make you worry about ""opportunity costs""—other ways you could be using your money or the trade-off of spending those resources today. It's when you find yourself saying, ""If I spend $10,000 on this, I won't have it to spend on something else I might want or need down the line.""

Naturally, you'd expect this to be more of a concern for investors with insufficient savings. But as mentioned above, farsighted investors with sufficient funds can be impacted too, as their natural tendency is to focus on the future and exercise too much self-control.

Some of my clients who grew up during the Great Depression know what it's like to have an uncertain future or worry about where their next meal will come from. Their experiences have reinforced the value of the dollar and led them to work hard and make sacrifices to build a secure retirement. They grew up living very frugally and some feel they don't need much beyond the necessities. As a result, they sometimes find it difficult to indulge. For example, one of my clients wanted to take her family on vacation to build memories but was afraid she might need the money for future health care costs.

We overcame these concerns by employing some of the strategies mentioned above. We revisited why she invested in the first place, discussed how she might feel later if she didn't take the trip, and reviewed the impact to her financial plan—taking 10,000 market scenarios into account. At the end of the day, she just needed to be reminded of her goals and to find peace of mind by seeing the bottom line—whether she could afford to take this trip without jeopardizing her other long-term goals.

Being focused on the long term and taking a disciplined approach to investing are part of our core investing principles. But if you're in a good financial position, there comes a time when it's okay to live out the retirement you planned for.

Memories are priceless. That's why one of the most rewarding parts of my job is watching my clients gain the clarity they need to take that dream vacation or pursue another retirement goal.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/3-behavioral-factors-can-affect-retirement-spending,
retirement,2 ways to use retirement money early,"As you approach retirement, you may find that you’re in a comfy spot and want to retire early. But how can you enjoy an early retirement before you can access 401(k)s and IRAs penalty-free at 59½? The best way is to have savings invested in a taxable account. If you don’t, there are other ways to enjoy an early retirement—as long as you’re confident your financial situation allows for it! Take a look at some different ways to access your retirement money early without triggering a 10% early withdrawal penalty. We’ll cover: 

SEPPs 
The Rule of 55
SEPPs
Substantially equal periodic payments, or SEPPs, is a withdrawal option starting before age 59½ and lasting either until age 59½ or 5 years, whichever is later. While calculating your withdrawal amount can be a little complicated, be sure to do it correctly to avoid penalties. Let’s break down the 3 decisions you have to make if you choose SEPPs.

Decision 1: Choosing how to calculate the amount you take

First, you’ll need to pick a formula to calculate your withdrawal. Here are 3 methods to try:

Fixed amortization—usually results in the highest withdrawal amount. Once you determine the amount, it’ll remain the same in future years.

Required minimum distribution—usually results in the lowest withdrawal amount and is the simplest to calculate.

Fixed annuitization—usually results in an amount somewhere in the middle and remains the same every year.

Some of your decisions can be changed in later years! Your withdrawal amounts can change, but only if you pick certain elections at the beginning. That’s why it’s so important to be strategic and think about your long-term needs.

Decision 2: Choosing a method of determining your life expectancy

The decision you make will affect the amount of your SEPPs as well as the strategies that are available to you in the future. You can choose from 1 or more of these tables depending on your beneficiary designations and the calculation method you chose.

The single life expectancy table—usually results in the highest withdrawal amount.

The uniform life table—usually results in the lowest withdrawal amount.

The joint life and last survivor table—usually results in an amount somewhere in the middle unless the beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than the owner, then it becomes the lowest withdrawal amount.

Decision 3: Choosing your interest rate

If you chose the fixed amortization or fixed annuitization formula, you’ll need to choose an interest rate. You can choose whatever rate you want, as long as it doesn’t exceed the greater of 5% or 120% of the mid-term applicable federal rate. Just keep in mind that the higher the interest rate, the higher the withdrawal amount.

For more info on how to accurately calculate SEPPs, these FAQs from the IRS can help.

Remember: If you miss a payment, it’ll affect your current SEPP and retroactively penalize any other SEPPs before 59½, so always be sure to make payments on time.

The Rule of 55
55 may just become your new favorite number. If you’re looking to retire early, this might be a great option. The Rule of 55 is simple: If you leave your employer on or after the year you turn 55, you can begin taking withdrawals from your 401(k) for 403(b) from that employer.

The Rule of 55 is often seen as more flexible, easier-to-implement alternative to SEPPs for those who qualify. Here’s a closer look at what that means:

Because the Rule of 55 applies only to money in your most recent employer plan, consider consolidating all your qualifying assets into that plan before you leave your job.

Look into whether distributing employer stock eligible for net unrealized appreciation would allow you to access the money you need while costing you less in taxes. Once you start withdrawals, you can only do this by the end of that calendar year or you must wait until you meet another qualifying event.

The IRS allows you to take any number of withdrawals in any amount, but your employer might have specific requirements for withdrawal timing.

Do you work in the public sector? You might be able to access your money even earlier—starting at age 50.

You should also consider waiting until the year after you retire to start withdrawals. That way, you won’t have employment income and retirement withdrawals in the same tax year, potentially lowering your income and tax burden.

If you want to work part-time after retiring somewhere besides your last job, you can! Part-time work won’t impact your ability to take advantage of the Rule of 55.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/2-ways-to-use-retirement-money-early,
retirement,Fueling the FIRE movement: Updating the 4% rule for early retirees,"FIRE stands for “Financial Independence Retire Early.” FIRE investors save as much of their income as possible during their working years, hoping to attain financial independence at a young age and maintain it through the rest of their life—aka retirement.

The 4% rule, which aims to help retirees find a safe withdrawal rate for each year in retirement, may be right for investors with a 30-year retirement horizon. But others, including FIRE investors whose retirement horizon could be 50 years or more, will have better odds of making their savings last by customizing the 4% rule using Vanguard’s principles of investing success.

Updates to the 4% rule for FIRE investors
1. Estimate future returns using forward-looking predictions.

The 4% rule was tested using historical market performance data from 1926 to 1992. Since it worked for that time period, some investors have assumed it will be successful in other time periods. That’s a big assumption (and one I wouldn’t be willing to bet my retirement success on).

Relying on past performance to predict future returns can make you too confident about your likelihood of success—especially now, when bond yields are historically low. Strategic market and economic forecasts are more likely to accurately predict what the future holds.

Vanguard uses the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM), our financial simulation engine, to forecast future performance by analyzing historical data that drive asset returns. (Vanguard’s economic and market outlook research is updated regularly; it’s located on our Investment research & commentary page.)

2. Use an appropriate retirement horizon.

The 4% rule is based on a 30-year retirement horizon. However, a FIRE investor’s retirement could last 50 years or more. That’s a big difference! According to our VCMM calculations, the 4% rule gives an investor with a 30-year retirement horizon about an 82% chance of success—but a FIRE investor with a 50-year retirement horizon only a 36% chance of success.**

Your time horizon is an important factor when defining your goals. We recommend calculating your withdrawal rate using a realistic retirement time frame.

3. Minimize costs.

It’s important to note that the 4% rule didn’t factor investment fees into estimated returns, which also affects its likelihood of success.

If we reevaluate a FIRE investor’s 36% chance of success by applying a 0.2% expense ratio to their portfolio, their estimated success rate drops to less than 28%. With a 1% expense ratio, that estimate drops to less than 9%.**

As the numbers show, minimizing costs allows for a significantly higher likelihood of success.

4. Invest in a diversified portfolio.

The 4% rule was calculated using only U.S. assets. Vanguard believes investing in a diversified portfolio increases your chances of success regardless of your anticipated retirement horizon or financial goal.

In our calculations, we assumed the FIRE investor’s portfolio contained only U.S. stocks and bonds. If that investor has a diversified portfolio with U.S. and international assets, their chance of success jumps from 36% to 56%.** 

To get the full benefit of diversification, Vanguard recommends investing about 40% of your stock allocation in international stocks and about 30% of your bond allocation in international bonds. According to Vanguard research, almost 90% of your investment portfolio’s performance—in other words, if (and how much) your portfolio gains or loses—is the result of your asset mix.†

5. Use a dynamic spending strategy.

Once FIRE investors achieve financial independence, they have to spend strategically to maintain that independence over the long term.

The 4% rule uses a dollar-plus-inflation strategy. In your first year of retirement, you spend 4% of your savings. After your first year, you increase that amount annually by inflation. This approach allows you to calculate a stable, inflation-adjusted amount to withdraw each year.

However, this approach doesn’t take market performance into account. So when the markets perform poorly, you still increase your annual spending to offset inflation, which increases the chance of depleting your retirement savings. On the other hand, when the markets perform well, you don’t have the flexibility to raise your spending amount beyond the inflation increase to take advantage of excess returns.

Although every spending strategy has pros and cons, we recommend using a dynamic spending strategy. This approach allows you to spend more when markets perform well and cut spending when they don’t. To avoid big fluctuations in retirement income, you set a limited range for your income stream by defining a spending “ceiling” and a spending “floor.”

Giving yourself more spending flexibility may decrease your income stability, but it increases your long-term chance of success. Our research shows that when a FIRE investor with a 50-year retirement horizon uses a dynamic spending strategy, their probability of success in retirement increases from 56% to 90%.**

Success in retirement
Creating a clear, appropriate investment goal is Vanguard’s first principle of investing success, and FIRE investors certainly have one: to achieve financial independence early and maintain it over the long term. Updating the 4% rule in accordance with Vanguard’s principles of investing success can help FIRE investors achieve that goal, giving them freedom to embark on their next adventure.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/fueling-the-fire-movement-updating-the-4-rule-for-early-retirees,
retirement,Retiring? Plan for these 7 birthdays.,"So kick back, put your feet up, and celebrate these 7 ages—cake optional.

Age 59½
Celebrate: You can withdraw from your IRA and 401(k) without penalty
Age 59½ may be worth a small party. After you reach this milestone, you can withdraw from your traditional retirement accounts without being subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.* Keep in mind you'll still owe federal income tax on your withdrawals.

Age 62
Celebrate: You're eligible for Social Security benefits
The best time to collect depends on personal circumstances, but 62 is the earliest age you can claim Social Security retirement benefits. You'll take a hit for claiming early, so only file if you need the money. How long you think you'll live, how many assets you have, and whether you want to leave an inheritance are a few factors that can determine when to start collecting. If you can hold off, that's another reason to celebrate!

Age 64¾
Celebrate: You can apply for extra benefits—like Medicare
It's nice to know you'll have support for health care costs when you stop working. The 7-month initial sign-up window to enroll in Medicare starts 3 months before you turn 65.** If you enroll within 3 months of your birthday month, you can avoid paying higher premiums. Just remember: If you still have employer-sponsored medical insurance, you can wait until that coverage ends. Check out your Medicare options today so you can figure out what will work best for you.

Age 65
Celebrate: You have more options—including Medigap
Medigap is supplemental private health insurance that covers some of the costs not covered by traditional Medicare. If you decide to purchase Medigap, the enrollment period begins the first day of the month you turn 65. During the enrollment window, you can't be denied Medigap coverage or charged extra because of poor health. Like Medicare, you can wait to sign up for Medigap if you have insurance through an employer.

Age 66-67
Celebrate: You're eligible for full Social Security
This is the age you qualify for your full Social Security retirement benefit (based on your birth year). Your benefit amount will increase each month you wait, until age 70 when it stops increasing. So you may want to hold off even longer depending on your circumstances.

Age 70
Celebrate: You'll want to file for Social Security (if you haven't already)
Don't put off filing for Social Security retirement benefits past age 70. At this age, your benefits won't increase by postponing them. If you waited this long, your benefits could be nearly one-third higher than if you'd claimed them at your full retirement age—just one more reason to celebrate turning 70.

Age 73
Celebrate: You begin taking RMDs
This is the age when tax deferrals on traditional IRAs and 401(k)s run out. Generally, you must withdraw your RMD (required minimum distribution) for a given year by December 31 of that year. However, if you're taking an RMD for the first time, you may delay withdrawing until April 1 of the year after you turn age 73***. If you decide to delay taking your first RMD, you'll have to take 2 RMDs that calendar year, which may put you in a higher tax bracket. Whenever you decide to withdraw your money, be sure to thank yourself for preparing for this important stage of life.

These milestones may seem unusual to celebrate, but each of them signifies another benefit that you've earned. You've done the hard work to accumulate your nest egg—now let your investments do the rest. Together, we can make retirement the best chapter of your life.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/retirement-by-age,
investment types,How to get the most from your cash,"What does it mean to keep money ""in cash""?
First, what is cash? Cash can take many forms, including money held in your bank account or wallet. Additionally, there are cash investments (also known as cash equivalents), which are a type of short-term investment product that earns interest.

In that sense, we define ""cash"" as a readily available short-term financial instrument with high liquidity, minimal or negligible market risk, and a maturity period of less than 3 months.

How much money should you keep in cash?
While cash may not be ideal for long-term investment goals, it's always a good idea to maintain a reserve of cash that can serve a variety of purposes. If you don't have the right amount of cash on hand when you need it, you may be forced to sell out of the market at an inopportune time, which can hinder your investment outcome. Keep enough to cover your regular spending needs, including both your cost-of-living expenses and your discretionary shopping budget.

Don't forget to set aside cash for your emergency fund. You should hold enough cash to cover potential spending shocks—unplanned expenses like a surprise home repair or a broken appliance—that require immediate funds. Income shocks are another scenario to consider for emergency savings. However, given their rarity, you may weigh the potential missed investment opportunities before deciding to maintain this reserve entirely in cash.

Beyond these basic considerations, some investors, especially those with a low risk tolerance, might choose to keep extra cash for added security. However, it's important to be aware of the opportunity cost associated with holding more cash than necessary. If you decide to go this route, make sure to consider options that offer the highest possible return on your cash holdings to maximize your financial benefits.

Where to put your cash
After you decide how much you want to save in cash, then you can consider where to place your savings. When choosing where to allocate your cash, you can select from a range of cash options, including but not limited to a bank account, a money market fund, a CD, or even individual Treasury bills. It's most important to identify features you value in how to access your cash in deciding among these options.

As our clients consider where to place their savings, we encourage them to consider a few brutal facts on how savings selection can impact their investment outcomes:

Brutal fact #1
Most investors keep their savings in bank accounts—which typically earn lower returns than many other savings options. 

Banking assets alone represent 10% of individual investor wealth, most of which resides in savings and checking accounts.1 Research has shown that the median bank account balance of U.S. individual investors is around $8,000 and the mean is more than $62,000,2 concentrating cash assets in places where they may not be generating meaningful returns.  

Banking assets represent $5.6T or 10% of household wealth

Brutal fact #2
Traditional banks aren't keeping up. More return is possible beyond traditional checking and savings accounts.

At Vanguard, we offer a Cash Plus Account that features a bank sweep program with a competitive annual percentage yield (APY)3 and FDIC coverage.4 The Cash Plus Account also offers some features similar to a checking or savings account, such as account and routing numbers.5  You can keep your money in the bank sweep or diversify into 5 available money market funds (each with a $3,000 minimum investment).

The Vanguard Cash Plus bank sweep program APY is 3.65% effective January 6, 2025.
Brutal fact #3
Not seeking a higher-yielding savings option can cost investors long-term wealth.

Historically, investors have seen a range of return outcomes on their cash options. As illustrated, Vanguard's Cash Plus Account not only provides valuable functionality, but it also can generate meaningful wealth creation on cash. For example, if an investor placed $10,000 in the Cash Plus Account's bank sweep versus the average savings account in May 2022, they'd have received nearly $1,000 more in interest on average. Bottom line - not seeking a higher-yielding savings option can cost investors wealth creation in the long run.

investment types,How bonds can strengthen your portfolio,"1. Bonds play an important role as a source of both stability and income
Bond prices tend to move in the opposite direction of stock prices. When stock prices are down, bond prices tend to be up, and vice versa. Bonds spread out your portfolio's risk and help reduce the overall chance of loss. Higher bond yields can offer a “coupon wall” to soften the downside and a stronger base to grow on the upside. Just as with any other asset class, it's important to make sure your bond holdings are appropriately diversified to reduce risk.

2. Bond returns may offer more secure inflation protection than cash
In 2022, many investors sold bonds to move into ""safer"" cash when yields rose and bond prices dropped. But keep in mind that each asset class has a part to play in your target portfolio mix. In addition to offering more balance against stocks, bonds have shown themselves to be much better at keeping up with inflation over time compared with cash.

Since 1975—50 years—annual bond total returns have beat inflation 71% of the time compared to only 57% of the time for cash. The after-inflation return for bonds averaged 3.1% versus only 0.6% from cash.1

Check out these portfolio allocation models to help you decide how much to invest in bonds and stocks.

3. Diversifying your bond portfolio can help manage risk
Broad-based bond funds and ETFs are a simple and effective way to get exposure to the U.S. and international bond markets. A single bond fund may hold hundreds—or thousands—of individual bonds, potentially offering diversification across diﬀerent issuers, qualities, and maturities. Investors may consider either passively managed index strategies, actively managed funds, or a mix of both.

It can take time and capital to build a well-diversified portfolio of individual bonds. If you only have individual bonds for ﬁxed income assets, you might consider supplementing your portfolio with bond mutual funds or ETFs. 

Check out our bond funds

4. Focus on what you can control
It's natural for economic factors to test your resilience and discipline, but market volatility shouldn't drive major changes to your portfolio. When you're concerned, take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and consider why you're investing in the first place.

You can't control the economy, but you can control your asset allocation. Stick to Vanguard's Principles for Investing Success (PDF) and focus on a balanced portfolio aligned to your personal goals.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/how-bonds-can-strengthen-portfolio,
investment types,Are bonds a good investment right now?,"Why should I invest in bonds?
Nobel Prize-winning economist Harry Markowitz called diversification ""the only free lunch in finance."" Bonds have played an essential role in diversifying investor portfolios and helping to mitigate portfolio losses during periods of negative equity returns. And we believe bonds will continue to play a valuable role in offsetting stock losses over the long term.

""Diversification benefits are back,"" said Sara Devereux, global head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group. ""2022 was a highly unusual year. Over the long term, bonds continue to be a great diversifier to equity stress.""

Diversifying your portfolio across stocks and bonds can help lower your overall risk and reduce volatility. When you may be tempted to abandon your investment plan in favor of market-timing moves, it's important to remember that sticking to your asset allocation is often the best strategy for keeping your long-term goals on track. 

Should I invest in bonds now?
Here are 3 reasons why now's a good time to evaluate the role of high-quality fixed income exposure in your portfolio.

Number 1
Bonds are providing healthier yields than we've seen since before the 2008 global financial crisis. Higher current yields support a much-improved outlook for bond returns going forward. Higher yields can help reduce risk by acting as a buffer to additional rate increases while also providing a stronger base for future returns if the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates in the future. As a result, bonds may provide you with attractive yields at a lower risk profile than we've seen in recent years.

Higher yields can offer a cushion against rising rates and a boost against falling rates

Number 2
After a year like 2022, it may be tempting to wait in cash for the right moment to reinvest in bonds. But predicting the path of interest rates is notoriously hard to do, and nobody can be sure if we've reached peak interest rates in the Federal Reserve's march to contain inflation. The decision to shift your long-term portfolio from bonds to cash comes with risks to your long-term financial goals. Over long time periods, bonds have provided better returns than cash. And as history has shown, they've also outperformed cash in the 3-year period following peak rate hikes dating back to 1980.

Bonds typically outperform cash in the 3 years following peak federal funds rates

Number 3
Strong bond returns relative to cash can also be seen during recessions since 1980. ""While it's always possible that the next recession features a different pattern of relative returns, it pays to remember that bonds have tended to outperform during recessions,"" said Sara Devereux.

Bonds have historically performed better than stocks and cash during recessions

Should I consider moving from bonds to cash?
When it comes to your asset allocation, cash is a great option to meet shorter-term spending needs or goals like building your emergency savings. But for your longer-term goals, you may want to consider taking advantage of the benefits bonds bring to a balanced portfolio.

Short-term market-timing moves can put your portfolio at risk because the future path of interest rates is nearly impossible to time. Over the long term, high-quality bond funds have tended to offer better diversification against stock volatility and higher yield potential than cash.

While the road ahead may be a bit bumpy, sticking to your investment plan is an important step toward keeping your long-term goals on track.

investment types,The future of cryptocurrency,"At a glance
Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity over the past several years.
While some investors have seen quick success with crypto, our investing principles emphasize building a diversified portfolio and tuning out the noise.
A continued focus on your goals and investing for the long term will give you the best chance for investment success.
Cryptocurrencies haven't been around for long, but they've gained traction as one of the hottest—and most speculative—investments on the market. While it may be tempting to chase the latest investing trend, our guidance is to avoid fads, stay focused on your goals, and invest for the long term.

What's a cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that serve as a medium of exchange or store of value. They're recorded and transferred on an online ledger known as blockchain, which is distributed on a peer-to-peer network. Learn more about cryptocurrencies.

Is there value in owning cryptocurrency?
Some investors have had success trading various cryptocurrencies in the short term. However, there are a few issues that can make crypto a problematic investment for long-term portfolios.

They’re highly speculative. While you may gain a quick win with these investments, there's no evidence that they're built for the long term.
They have significant price volatility. Market swings happen, but the price fluctuations of many cryptocurrencies make them relatively unstable.
They have high commissions. Many crypto exchanges charge high fees to trade, with some as high as 2.5% per trade. We believe in low-cost investing. In fact, Vanguard charges $0 in commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs, and Vanguard mutual funds.

investment types,All about ETFs,"What is an ETF?
An ETF is a collection of hundreds or thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund that trades on major stock exchanges, like the NYSE or the Nasdaq. ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they’re both professionally managed funds and both trade commission-free online at Vanguard Brokerage (some non-Vanguard mutual funds do have a commission).

What are the benefits of ETFs?
Unlike mutual funds that could require a hefty minimum investment, you can purchase a Vanguard ETF for as little as $1, and you have more control over the order type. If you want to enjoy these benefits while still investing in an index fund, take a look at Vanguard index ETFs.

investment types,The dynamics of bond duration and rising rates,"How interest rates affect coupons and prices
Government bond investors are exposed to two types of risk from interest rate movements:

Reinvestment risk. When yields are falling, investors reinvest cash flow from bond coupon payments at lower rates, reducing the yield component of future total returns. On the other hand, in a rising rate environment such as the one we’re in now, they can reinvest cash flow at higher rates, increasing the yield component of future total returns.  
Market price risk. The market price of a bond is determined by discounting future cash flows at the current market interest rate. Falling interest rates make a bond’s future coupon payments worth more and, by extension, increase its current market price, and rising rates make a bond’s future coupon payments worth less, decreasing its current market price. How much more or less is determined by the time until the bond reaches maturity. The future cash flow of a bond maturing in 2 years will be affected much less by a change in interest rates than that of a bond maturing in 30 years. The standard yardstick to measure this sensitivity of a bond’s market price to a change in interest rates is duration, expressed in years.
These relationships apply to individual bonds as well as bond portfolios, funds, and ETFs.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/the-dynamics-of-bond-duration-and-rising-rates,
investment types,Cryptocurrencies and Vanguard: What we think,"What's a cryptocurrency?
A cryptocurrency is a digital asset stored on blockchain technology that serves as a type of currency or store of value. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by major governments or developed economies. This decentralization means blockchain technology validates these digital transactions without oversight or intermediaries. While cryptocurrencies are generally meant to serve as a medium of exchange, much of the attention they receive is as a financial investment. 

Technology talks
It's hard to talk about cryptocurrencies without acknowledging the savvy technology behind them. Cryptocurrencies are stored and transferred on an online ledger known as blockchain, which is distributed on a peer-to-peer network. These ledgers are public, and once transactions are recorded, they can't be changed. Blockchain technology offers key benefits such as accuracy, transparency, and speed.

Realize the risks
The surging value of various cryptocurrencies—such as bitcoin, dogecoin, and the like—can make it tempting to invest, but consider these risks before purchasing a digital currency:

With value comes volatility. In recent years, cryptocurrency prices have experienced wider fluctuations than traditional assets (such as stocks and bonds) and some have had dramatic short-term drops. This volatility makes cryptocurrencies impractical as a medium of exchange, and the sudden price movements can encourage impulsive buying and selling. Additionally, these market conditions can make it difficult to liquidate a position in a timely manner, making liquidity risk a real concern.
Risk without reward. Unlike stocks and bonds, cryptocurrencies don't pay dividends or cash payments, and therefore don't offer any intrinsic value for the sizable amount of risk the investor takes on.
Who's in charge here? As stated earlier, cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated without the backing of major governments or economies. This lack of regulation makes it unlikely that cryptocurrencies will be able to achieve the value and quality of other currencies. Additionally, the anonymity of the digital transactions lends them to possible illegal activity. 
Cybersecurity scares. Cryptocurrency exchanges are subject to breaches, disruptions, and failures that can jeopardize investors and their personal information. Since cryptocurrencies aren't currently backed by any major governments, investors are unlikely to recover lost funds. 
Vanguard's take
Since cryptocurrencies are highly speculative in their current state, Vanguard believes their long-term investment case is weak. As many of our clients know, our investing philosophy encourages staying the course and tuning out the noise. Our time-tested principles emphasize that long-term investing is essential and reacting to short-term trends can be costly for one's portfolio. While we don't currently offer cryptocurrencies as an investment option, we acknowledge the impact they're making in the investing world. As cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream, we'll continue to monitor their development and discern the best path forward for our investors.

investment types,"Investing in a stock, bond, ETF, or mutual fund","Investment products
An investment product gives you access to a single asset class or a combination of asset classes. An individual stock or bond exposes you to a single asset class—stocks or bonds, respectively—while a single ETF or mutual fund can expose you to one or more asset classes.

Individual stock

A stock is traded on a major exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. When you own a stock, you essentially own part of a specific company, and you get some of its assets and profits.
 

Individual bond

A bond is a loan. When you purchase a bond, you’re lending money to the bond issuer (e.g., a government, government agency, or corporation) in exchange for repayment plus interest by a specified date (maturity).
 

An index (i.e., a market benchmark) is a selection of stocks, bonds, or other securities that represents what’s going on in the overall market. For example, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index represents 500 of the largest U.S. companies.
 

ETF

An ETF (exchange-traded fund) bundles together many stocks or bonds in a single investment and may track an index. When you own an ETF, you own a portion of its underlying portfolio. An ETF also trades on major exchanges.
 

Mutual fund

A mutual fund, like an ETF, bundles together many stocks, bonds, or other securities in a single investment and may track an index. But there’s a notable difference in how you buy and sell ETFs versus mutual funds. ETFs trade on major stock exchanges directly from one investor to another, while mutual fund companies, banks, and brokerage firms buy and sell mutual funds.

What to consider
1. Cost
Cost matters when you’re investing. The less money you spend, the more you keep. The cost of an investment depends primarily on its expense ratio and commission. 


Expense ratio

An expense ratio is the percentage of a fund’s total assets that goes toward the cost of running the fund each year. For example, if you invest $1,000 in an ETF or a mutual fund with a 0.10% expense ratio, you’ll pay $1 a year in fees. If you invest the same amount in a fund with an expense ratio of 0.60%, you’ll pay $6 a year.

Commission

A commission is a fee you pay to a broker each time you buy or sell 1 or more shares of an individual stock, bond, or ETF. For example, if you buy shares of 20 individual stocks, you’ll be subject to 20 commission charges. If each commission is $5, that’s $100 (regardless of the total amount you invest).

Similar to an expense ratio, when you pay less in commissions, you have more money available to compound.

2. Investment style
An investment style describes a technique used to pursue a goal. Some investment products, including mutual funds and ETFs, can be active or passive. 


Active

Actively managed funds seek to outperform the market and generate above-average returns. An active fund’s portfolio management team relies on research, market forecasting, and personal experience to decide which bonds and stocks they’re going to buy. Although actively managed funds attempt to beat the market, they may underperform the market. Mutual funds offer the biggest selection of actively managed funds, but some ETFs are actively managed too.

Passive

A passively managed fund—known as an index fund—holds all (or a sample) of the bonds or stocks in the index it tracks. The fund then mirrors the index and only buys or sells when the index makes a significant change. Most ETFs are passively managed, whereas mutual funds can be either passively or actively managed.


3. Convenience
If you’re like most investors, the amount of time and effort you want to spend building a diversified portfolio may be the most important factor in choosing an investment product.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/investing-in-a-stock-bond-etf-or-mutual-fund,
taxes,"A ""BETR"" calculation for the Traditional-to-Roth IRA conversion equation","What is the break-even tax rate (BETR)?
With the BETR approach, future tax rate expectations are but one factor in the conversion decision. The approach levels up the analysis by taking into account crucial factors like conversion-tax proceeds paid from account assets held outside the IRA, the tax basis of the IRA account, and future plans to contribute to the IRA (typically using a backdoor strategy).

At its most basic form, BETR is that future tax rate at which the after-tax withdrawal value for an investor would be the same in both the no-conversion and conversion scenarios.

In a sense, the conversion decision will depend on this single figure. If an investor’s future tax rate is greater than the BETR, it makes sense to convert; if the future tax rate is lower than the BETR, it doesn’t. 

How to use the single-figure break-even tax rate to decide if a Roth conversion is the best choice
Expected future tax rate space greater-than sign space BETR space equals sign space conversion Or Expected future tax rate space less-than sign space BETR space equals sign space no conversion
How to lower the BETR
Even better: The BETR is not a static number. There are investor choices that can lower the rate, and this, in effect, expands the pool of those who could ultimately benefit from the long-term tax advantages of a Roth conversion. Investors can: 

Pay conversion taxes from a taxable account. Tapping into a separate cache of cash allows the full value of the IRA to move to a tax-advantaged account. The more tax-inefficient the account used to pay the conversion tax, the lower the BETR (and the greater the benefit of converting).
Invest over a longer time horizon. The longer the time frame, the greater the potential for Roth assets to compound tax-free, and the lower the BETR for Roth-converting investors who pay the conversion tax from taxable assets.
Use the Roth conversion as an opportunity to make future backdoor Roth IRA contributions. Only investors filing under a certain income limit qualify for Roth IRA contributions—but the two-step backdoor Roth conversion strategy is open to investors at all income levels. By using the backdoor method, you can contribute up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you’re 50 or older) to your Roth IRA for the 2025 tax year. Over time, that adds up to a lot of tax-advantaged investment opportunities. And don’t forget to consider your IRA’s tax basis. Nondeductible contributions will not be taxed again during a Roth conversion. This, too, will lower the BETR. 
Other often-overlooked considerations
“The value of a Roth conversion is often underestimated and underappreciated,” says Wong. That’s because the tax benefits of a Roth account are difficult to capture fully with the traditional rule of thumb—or even when with the more sophisticated BETR calculation. Those benefits include:

Greater potential for tax advantages after the loss of a spouse. As of 2025, a couple with a $60,000 annual income falls in the 12% tax bracket, while a widowed single filer with the same income may land in the 22% bracket. 
Reduced required minimum distribution (RMD) demands. Roth IRAs have no RMD, and they are not subject to RMD rules during the owner’s lifetime. 
Enhanced flexibility around the Medicare and Social Security tax cliffs. Roth IRA withdrawals do not affect the taxable income levels that affect these benefits.
“Paying taxes now to avoid higher taxes in the future can be a valuable strategy for many investors,” Dickson says. “The BETR calculation can make a traditional-to-Roth conversion more accessible than the conventional analysis suggests.”",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/a-betr-calculation-for-the-traditional-to-roth-ira-conversion-equation,
taxes,Tax tips to help you prepare for 2025,"Here are 4 tax-saving tips you can use to help you get on track for next year.
Number 1
Max out your IRAs
IRAs are a great way to save for retirement and reduce your taxes. For 2024, the maximum contribution for both traditional and Roth IRAs is $7,000 ($8,000 if you're age 50 or older).

Investing in a traditional IRA and contributing the maximum can help reduce your taxable income.1 And while your contributions to a Roth IRA aren't tax-deductible, you can save money on taxes later. That's because Roth IRAs allow you to make tax-free withdrawals as long as you're age 59½ or older and you've owned the account for at least 5 years.2

Number 2
Offset gains by harvesting your losses
If you have investment losses in 2024, you can use them to offset both your investment gains and ordinary income up to $3,000. This strategy, known as tax-loss harvesting, offers a way to help reduce your taxable income. In short, you can sell investments at a loss to offset your gains from other investments.3

If you buy the same investment or any investment the IRS considers ""substantially identical"" within 30 days before or after you sold at a loss, you won't be allowed to claim a deduction on the loss. This is known as the wash sale rule. If you need guidance on whether an investment would be considered substantially identical, consult a tax advisor.

Number 3
Learn the implications of changing your filing status
Your tax-filing status can have a significant impact on your tax liability. If you're considering making a change to your filing status, be sure to understand the tax implications.4 For example, if you're married and filing jointly, you'll have a higher standard deduction and a lower tax bracket than if you file separately. However, if you have a high household income, you may be able to save money on your taxes by filing separately. Considering your options now can make for a smoother tax season in 2025.

Number 4
Seek tax-efficient investments
When you choose tax-efficient investments, you can help reduce your tax bill for 2025 and beyond. Here are some examples:

Tax-deferred accounts like traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans allow you to defer your investment gains until you start withdrawing your money.
Investments like municipal bonds are generally exempt from federal income tax.
Tax-advantaged accounts like 529 plans and health savings accounts offer tax benefits that can help reduce your tax liability.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/year-end-tax-tips,
taxes,Keep more of what you earn through tax-efficient investing,"Investment tax efficiency: hierarchy of opportunity
Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts. For many investors, the low-hanging tax fruit is their 401(k), IRA, or other tax-advantaged retirement plan. In terms of order, Vanguard recommends a retirement plan first, if one is available, up to the amount that captures the employer match. What should come after that is not always clear-cut but a combination of tax-deferred and after-tax (e.g., Roth) accounts can offer flexibility when accounting for an investor's time horizon, expected future tax rate, and income flexibility needs in retirement (to offset Social Security and Medicare tax cliffs, for example).

Outside of retirement planning, certain health savings accounts (HSAs) and education savings plans (e.g., 529s) can also offer attractive tax advantages worth considering.

Control tax costs through trading and asset placement strategies. Tax-aware investors can strategically hold or sell from a brokerage account to lower capital gains tax or harvest losses for a later offset. Attractive yet tax-inefficient investments—like an actively managed mutual fund with higher turnover—can be held inside a tax-advantaged account, so dividend or short-term capital gains payouts can remain sheltered. In short, a little investor education on tax treatment can go a long way toward generating better after-tax portfolio returns.

Reduce tax penalties. Retirement savers may be unaware of the full impact of an early withdrawal, the taxable event one may create, or the potential penalty. Advice is often the key link that can help an investor make tax-efficient, cost-conscious decisions—even during a time of need—that can increase the likelihood of keeping long-term goals on track.

The stakes are high
Taxes may be one of two certainties in life, but investors don't have to pay more than their due.

With the help of advisors, tax professionals, and client-centric education, investor tax bills could be meaningfully minimized. More widespread use of holistic, tax-aware planning strategies, and better tax-related communications, disclosures, and educational efforts could go a long way toward getting investors closer to their financial goals.

At the end of the day, it's not how much investors earn that defines success. It's how much they keep.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/keep-more-of-what-you-earn-through-tax-efficient-investing,
taxes,Your top tax questions answered,"How are taxable brokerage accounts and retirement accounts taxed?
With taxable brokerage accounts, you invest cash on which you've already paid income taxes, such as money from your paycheck. However, you may still owe taxes on future income or growth from these investments. For example, dividend income is taxed in the year you receive it, even if you haven't sold the investment, while the growth on capital gains is taxed when you sell your investment.

Retirement accounts such as traditional and Roth IRAs, as well as retirement plans like 401(k)s, are geared toward long-term saving and investing, so they receive special tax treatment. With traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, your contributions can be tax deductible in the year they're made with earnings taxed upon distribution. Contributions to Roth IRAs and 401(k)s are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you've already paid income taxes on the money you're contributing. And you won't pay taxes on qualified withdrawals of your earnings.1

What's capital gains tax and when do I pay it?
Capital gains tax is charged on profits made from the sale of an investment. In other words, if you sell an investment for more than you paid for it, you may owe capital gains tax on your earnings. The exact rate you'll pay is determined by your overall income level and how long you held the assets before selling. Unless you're required to make estimated tax payments, you'll pay capital gains tax when you file your income tax return.

Let's look at an example:
Let's say you buy 1 share of ABC Company for $10 in your taxable brokerage account. You later sell that share for $15. The result is a realized capital gain of $5. You'll only owe capital gains tax on the $5 profit, not the entire $15. The original $10 is considered your ""cost basis""—the amount invested.

What are realized and unrealized gains?
You ""realize"" capital gains when you sell an investment in your taxable brokerage account for more than you paid for it. If your investment has increased in value and you haven't sold it, your gain is considered ""unrealized."" You don't owe capital gains tax on unrealized gains.

Does the length of time I own the investment affect my tax rate?
Yes, the holding period matters. If you've owned your investment for more than 1 year before selling at a gain, you're subject to long-term capital gains tax rates. If you've owned your investment for one year or less before selling at a gain, you're taxed at short-term capital gains rates.

To encourage long-term investing, long-term capital gains receive special tax treatment. Most individuals are taxed either 0%, 15%, or 20% on their realized long-term capital gains. Investors subject to short-term capital gains rates are taxed at their ordinary income tax rate, which can range from 0% to 37%.

What if I have more losses than gains?
If you sell your investment for less than you originally paid for it, you could be entitled to take a capital loss. When an investment is sold for less than its original purchase price, the difference in value is considered a capital loss. While we never want our investments to lose value, investors who realize a capital loss in their taxable brokerage accounts can potentially use that loss to lower their taxable income or offset future capital gains, through a strategy like tax-loss harvesting.

What's tax-loss harvesting?

Tax-loss harvesting is when you intentionally sell securities at a loss to offset capital gains. You can offset all your capital gains with losses during the same tax year, plus up to $3,000 of ordinary income if you're single or married, filing jointly (up to $1,500 each if you're married, filing separately). You can use this strategy to lower your tax liability when rebalancing your portfolio.

Tax-loss harvesting only applies to taxable brokerage accounts. It can be complex, but it offers a sophisticated way to turn market volatility into a tax-savings opportunity.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/top-tax-questions-answered,
taxes,Effective tax-saving strategies for investors,"1. Consider tax-efficient investments
There are many factors to consider when picking investments for your portfolio. When it comes to your nonretirement accounts, 2 such considerations are costs and tax eﬃciency.

Choosing investments with built-in tax eﬃciencies, such as index funds—including certain mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds)—is one way to minimize the tax drag on your returns.

ETFs may oﬀer an additional tax advantage. The way their transactions settle allows them to avoid triggering some capital gains. Because ETFs may oﬀer the best of both worlds—low costs and tax eﬃciency—they can be an effective foundation for your investment portfolio. 

Note: Index mutual funds track a benchmark, so their goal is to track the benchmark's performance. If you're looking to outperform a benchmark, you may want to consider active funds. An advisor can help you review your options.

2. Reduce your taxable income with a health savings account (HSA)
One way to minimize the taxes you pay at the end of the year is to put some of your income into an HSA, a tax-advantaged savings account  that lets you set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. Money you deposit in the current year that you don't use for qualified expenses remains in the account for future tax-free medical withdrawals. Once you turn 65, you can take penalty-free—but not tax-free—distributions for any reason.

If you're enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, you're eligible to open an HSA. An advisor can help you decide if it makes sense to open one.

3. Divide assets among accounts with asset location
Picking tax‑eﬃcient investments is one method to maximize after-tax returns, but you also want to choose the right types of accounts to hold your investments.

At the highest level, asset location is a way to maximize after-tax returns by dividing your assets among taxable and tax-deferred accounts. You can put tax-efficient investments into taxable accounts and investments with a heavier tax burden into tax-advantaged accounts.


Examples of tax-efficient assets for taxable accounts

Index mutual funds, index

Examples of less tax-efficient assets for non-taxable accounts

ETFs, tax-exempt bond funds or individual bonds, individual stocks


Actively managed mutual funds and taxable bond funds or individual bonds

4. Look for opportunities to offset gains
As an investor, you're taxed on net capital gains—the amount you gained minus any investment losses—so any realized losses can help lower your tax bill.

The intentional selling of investments at a loss to lower taxes is known as tax-loss harvesting.1

If you have a year when your capital losses are greater than your capital gains, you can use up to $3,000 of net losses a year to oﬀset ordinary income on your federal income taxes. You can also carry forward losses to future tax years. As with any tax-related topic, tax-loss harvesting has rules and restrictions (such as the wash-sale rule, designed to prevent investors from claiming capital losses as tax deductions if they reenter a position too quickly) you should be aware of before using this method.

If you don't want to manage tax-loss harvesting alone, enroll in Vanguard Advice and enjoy our automated tax-loss harvesting service.

5. Take a tax-efficient approach to withdrawals
When you start taking money out of your portfolio, make sure your withdrawal strategy factors in taxes. 

Once you start drawing down from your nonretirement accounts, think about taking all income produced from your investments (dividends, interest, and capital gains) and moving it to a money market account—rather than reinvesting it—so you don't end up paying taxes twice. If you reinvest the income produced and then sell the shares for a gain, you'll owe taxes on the income produced and capital gains taxes on the appreciation. Using a strategic approach to withdrawals can help you keep more of your money.

6. Maximize charitable giving
If philanthropy is part of your investment goals, consider these strategies to make the most of your giving:

Gift appreciated securities, such as mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks, to minimize future capital gains. Not all charities can accept donations of investments, so you may need to donate through a donor-advised fund, such as Vanguard Charitable, which makes it easy. Learn more about donor-advised funds
If you don't take the standard deduction on your taxes, then itemizing cash donations on your return could help you take advantage of tax deductions up to certain limits.
Consider bunching charitable donations together in 1 year so you can itemize them on your return and get a larger tax deduction.
Donate up to $105,000 annually from your IRA directly to a qualiﬁed charity through a qualiﬁed charitable distribution . (Note: this limit is raised to $108,000 for tax year 2025). As long as certain rules are met (for example, you're at least 70½ when making the gift and the check is payable directly to the qualiﬁed charity), then the distribution shouldn't be taxable income. A qualified financial advisor can help you decide what's best.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/effective-tax-saving-strategies-for-investors,
taxes,How we report your cost basis information,"Cost basis reporting: An overview
All sales of mutual funds, most exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks will generate a Form 1099-B that provides detailed cost basis information to help you report capital gains and losses on your tax return.

Although we'll include details for sales of both covered shares and noncovered shares only the cost basis information for sales of covered shares will be reported to the IRS. Cost basis for sales of noncovered shares will be reported solely to you.

For mutual fund accounts
Form 1099-B lists sales, exchanges, and redemptions (including checkwriting activity) from most nonretirement accounts.

For brokerage accounts
Form 1099-B reports sales, mergers, bond maturities, and aggregate profits or losses on regulated futures contracts.

What's reported for my mutual fund sales?
You remain responsible for reporting your cost basis information to the IRS on Form 8949 and on Form 1040, Schedule D, for all shares sold, whether they're covered or noncovered.

For covered shares
The information you report in column (e) of Form 8949 must match what we send to the IRS on Form 1099-B. We aren't required to make certain adjustments that are necessary for your tax return. For example, we don't adjust basis for wash sales when the purchase or sale is in another account or for taxes paid on gifts. Pay close attention to the IRS instructions for Schedule D and Form 8949.
For noncovered shares
Vanguard only has average cost information for mutual funds, so you're responsible for your recordkeeping if you used another method.

personal finance,Taking steps to improve financial safety,"Steering clear of scams
Be cautious of these red flags associated with scams:

Unexpected contact: Certain scams start with contact from someone an investor does not know, which may occur via email, phone call, and text. A legitimate financial institution or government will never contact you asking for logon credentials, security codes, or Social Security numbers.
Emotional manipulation: With this common online exploitation tactic, a fraudster aims to gain a close short-term relationship with an investor with the promise of a long-term partnership.
Urgency: Scammers will often apply pressure to send money or share private information, using “limited time offers” or threatening law enforcement action to convince an investor to act quickly.
Complicated payment methods: Be wary of anyone asking to be paid in unusual forms such as gift cards, checks, cryptocurrency, and gold.
To add an extra layer of protection, investors should consider adding a trusted contact. A trusted contact is a person designated by the investor whom an institution can contact in the event of suspected financial exploitation, imposter scams, or cognitive decline. Additionally, designating a power of attorney to authorize an individual or entity to help manage accounts in case of illness or incapacitation keeps the investor’s assets in trusted hands. 

Other considerations to protect account security
“Cyber fraudsters are con artists at heart who prey on investors’ kindness, desires, and vulnerabilities,” said Vanessa Richards, global head of Fraud Prevention and Physical Security at Vanguard. “Always trust your gut—because if it seems too good to be true, it likely is.”

Here are some other ways investors can keep their financial data safe:

Never click on suspicious links. Report and then delete phishing emails and texts and ignore unsolicited pop-up requests to install software.
Be wary of requests for personal or financial information or money. Never give personal information to unknown callers, and don’t send money to someone you haven’t met in person.
Add an extra layer of security by using two-factor authentication to require a code sent by text, call, or email during logon. Update passwords frequently and avoid public wi-fi networks.

,Understanding financial wellness,"What is financial wellness?
Financial wellness is the ability to meet financial obligations and stay on track to meet future goals. It encompasses aspects like budgeting, managing debt, saving for emergencies, investing to achieve goals, and making informed financial decisions to help you feel more financially secure.

Wondering how Americans stack up? The average American adult has $6,501 in credit card debt.1 And about 34% don’t have enough money to cover an emergency expense of $1,000 without taking on debt.2

The good news? There are steps you can take today to boost your financial knowledge and improve your overall well-being, which we'll cover below. 

Benefits of financial wellness
Financial wellness can improve your well-being by helping reduce stress related to money. 65% of Americans surveyed say money is a significant source of stress; among those under age 43, that figure jumps to 82%.3 Personal finance issues can affect mental and physical health, sleep, self-esteem, relationships at home, and work productivity and attendance.4

Fortunately, focusing on financial wellness offers several benefits. It can help you:

Take a proactive approach to getting your finances under control.
Meet unexpected expenses.
Set the stage for financial gains and emotional wellness.
Feel a sense of security and control over your financial future.
Enjoy a more balanced, healthier lifestyle.
How to improve financial wellness
Balancing multiple financial goals isn't always easy, but Vanguard's financial wellness guide (PDF) identifies steps you can take to overcome challenges and achieve key financial milestones. It's built on a three-part flexible framework designed to help you balance current and future goals, build confidence, and progress toward financial freedom.

These 3 steps can help you identify opportunities for change, meet near-term financial obligations, and keep you on track to meet future goals:

1. Take control of your finances
Understanding your spending and saving habits and ensuring they align with your goals can contribute to financial wellness. Taking control of your finances begins with creating a budget and pursuing potentially rewarding opportunities that could improve your financial situation.

Create a budget that works for you. Our wellness guide has 4 popular budgeting methods and makes it easy to choose which budgeting style works for you based on 2 factors: what you want to budget for and if you like tracking your spending. Find a strategy that works for you, and that you can stick with over time.
Maximize your employer-matched savings. Find out if your employer plan offers a match. If it does, make room in your budget to contribute and earn the full match.
Pay the minimum on all your debt. Pay at least the monthly minimum(s) on all your loans. This will reduce costs over time and help improve your credit score. To ensure you don't fall behind on your payments, set up a reminder or automate them to save time and energy.
Pay down high-interest debt. Allocate as much as you can toward paying down high-interest debt. Increasing the monthly payment or taking advantage of onetime windfalls, such as tax refunds and work bonuses, is a great way to save on interest charges and free up more money for other priorities. 
2. Prepare for the unexpected
These strategies can help you maintain financial stability in the face of life's uncertainties:

Set up emergency savings for spending shocks. Aim to save at least $2,000 or half a month's worth of living expenses (whichever is greater) in a cash emergency fund for common spending shocks, such as a flat tire, home repairs, or unexpected travel.
Build up a contingency reserve in case of job loss. Aim to have about 3–6 months' worth of living expenses in readily accessible investments, like a taxable brokerage account, to cover an unexpected income shock.
Evaluate your insurance needs. It's important to consider which insurance features are essential to you and worth the cost. At the very least, consider purchasing health, life, disability, auto, and homeowners or renters insurance.
Get your legal documents in order to ensure your wishes are realized. Establish your will(s), name your beneficiaries, and designate a power of attorney.
3. Make progress toward your goals
These steps are designed to help you explore additional ways to stay on track with your longer-term goals.

Increase your savings and make the most of tax-advantaged accounts. Consider saving more in tax-advantaged accounts to help fund a comfortable retirement, cover education expenses with 529 plans, and manage current and future health expenses with health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible spending accounts (FSAs). Here are some effective saving strategies for lowering investment taxes.
Explore taxable accounts for added flexibility. Although these accounts don't offer tax benefits, they do provide flexibility. You can use them to save more than the amounts allowed in tax-advantaged accounts for retirement, health, and education, or to save for shorter-term goals such as house and vehicle down payments, vacation, and early retirement.
Consider paying off lower-interest debt. Evaluate your comfort level with debt and your liquidity needs. Determine whether you'll feel more peace of mind from paying down low-interest debt, using the extra money to invest and potentially earn a higher return in the market, or having additional cash on hand to cover emergency spending needs.
Develop a charitable giving strategy. Reflect on your desire to pass down assets to loved ones or support charitable causes. While your philanthropy may come with potential tax benefits, there are 2 key considerations to keep in mind: First, although donations to qualified organizations offer potential tax benefits, those benefits rarely exceed the total cost of the gift.5 Second, giving away assets today may affect your ability to achieve other financial goals. Before getting started, think through the benefits, timing, and amount of your gifts, and explore available ways to maximize the impact of your gift.
Achieving financial wellness
Vanguard's mission is to take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success. Part of that success includes being able to allocate budgets to pay bills, tackle debt, prepare for the unexpected, and invest to achieve long-term goals.

,10 ways to save more money,"Sometimes, the hardest thing is just getting started. These 10 tips will help you dive in and jump-start your savings.

1. Track your spending and expenses
It's hard to know how you can save money each month if you don't know where your money is going. By tracking your spending and expenses, you can easily see what categories you're spending in and where you could cut back. Budgeting doesn't have to be hard or time-consuming if you use these tips.

Use budgeting apps or spreadsheets to track expenses
Your budgeting could be as easy as using a spreadsheet, with income in one column and spending in another. Each time you get paid, make a purchase, or pay a bill, log it in the appropriate place. Some budgeting apps can automatically pull information from your bank account and credit cards, giving you a clear view of all your spending activity in one place.

Categorize expenses to identify areas where you can cut back
After tracking your spending for a month, you can categorize your expenses to gain valuable insights into your spending habits. How much money do you spend dining out? How much do you spend on streaming services? This allows you to identify areas where you might be overspending so you can adjust your budget.

Review your spending regularly to stay accountable and adjust
Budgeting is never a one-and-done task. It's an ongoing process that changes as your life circumstances change. Let's say you started your budgeting journey when your main goal was to get out of debt. Once you've achieved that goal, your budget should reflect it. You can then prioritize a new goal or allocate a higher dollar amount to saving and investing.

2. Set savings goals
Saving money without a clear purpose makes it hard to stay on track and measure progress. By assigning specific goals to your savings, you create a tangible target to work toward. Realistic, achievable goals will keep you motivated and make saving money a more rewarding experience.

Consider your short-term, mid-term, and long-term savings goals
Because life is a balance between short-, mid-, and long-term goals, it's helpful to categorize your savings accordingly. By structuring your savings this way, you can also use the most appropriate investment strategy for each time frame.

Short-term (1–3 years). How much money should you have saved for short-term savings? Start by building up an emergency fund of 3–6 months of living expenses. Keep this money in a low-risk, liquid account you can access easily. This is a safety net you can tap into if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, or face a major repair. Once your emergency fund is fully funded, you can focus on other short-term savings goals, such as upcoming vacations, new furniture, or electronics.
Mid-term (4–10 years). For goals like a home down payment, a wedding, or a new baby, use a moderately aggressive mix of stocks and bonds that can help you potentially grow your money faster.
Long-term (more than 10 years). Long-term goals include retirement, college, charitable giving, and legacy planning. Maximize growth potential with a higher equity allocation.
Set realistic deadlines for your savings goals
Just as it's important to set realistic, achievable goals, it's also important to set realistic deadlines for those goals. When setting a target date, work backward to determine how much you need to save per month to hit your goals. For example, if you're planning next year's vacation and think it'll cost $8,000, break it up into 12 monthly installments of $667.

Break down larger goals into smaller milestones to track progress
Some goals might feel so big that you may find it hard to stay motivated along the way. Break down these goals into incremental milestones along the way and celebrate when you hit them. If you're saving for a $30,000 down payment on a house, celebrate your wins and treat yourself when you hit the $5,000, $10,000, and $20,000 marks.

Write down your goals and keep them somewhere visible to stay motivated
The physical act of writing out your savings goals can help increase the odds you'll achieve them. Posting them somewhere visible can serve as a constant reminder of what you're working toward. Whether it's on your fridge or bathroom mirror, having your goals front and center makes them hard to ignore.

3. Determine how much to save each month
Without a specific amount in mind, it's easy for savings to become an afterthought. But how much of your paycheck should you save? One classic rule of thumb is to save 10%–20% of your net monthly income. But your ideal percentage can vary based on your unique goals and circumstances.

If you live in an expensive city, rent and groceries may eat up a big piece of your paycheck, making it difficult to hit the 20% mark. Don't get discouraged. The important thing is to start saving, no matter how little, and build on your successes.

Subtract your monthly expenses from your income to determine how much you can save
To determine how much you can save, start by listing your essential monthly expenses like your housing payment, utilities, groceries, transportation, debts, and insurance. Then deduct the total from your take-home pay. The remaining amount is what you can potentially save each month. From there, figure out how much to allocate to your different goals.

If you're not a fan of complicated budgeting, consider the 50/30/20 rule, which simplifies the budgeting process. It works like this:

Spend no more than 50% of your income on necessities, such as your rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, and debt obligations.
Less than 30% of your income should go to discretionary spending.
Dedicate at least 20% of your income to saving, both for retirement and shorter-term goals like vacations, a down payment, and emergency savings.
Let's say your monthly after-tax income is $8,000. Following the 50/30/20 rule, $4,000 would go to fixed expenses, $2,400 for things you want, and $1,600 for savings. By using this budgeting method, you could potentially save $19,200 in one year.

Calculate how much you need to save per month to reach your goals
Start by determining how much you need to save for a specific goal. Then divide that dollar amount by the deadline you've given yourself. For example, if you need $40,000 for a down payment on a home in 4 years (48 months), you'll need to save approximately $833 per month ($40,000/48).

4. Make a budget
Budgeting gets a bad rap, but it's an indispensable tool that can help you see how you can save money and where to trim to make it possible.

There are many budgeting strategies out there. Experiment with different approaches until you find the right system that works for your lifestyle and personality.

Include savings in your budget as nonnegotiable
Prioritizing savings from the start makes it a nonnegotiable habit. Rather than trying to save what's left over after expenses, treat savings like any other monthly ""bill."" When creating your budget, make a line item for savings that'll automatically contribute toward your savings goals each month, like paying rent and buying groceries.

Try a zero-based budget
With zero-based budgeting, your total income for the month minus expenses should equal zero. In other words, all your income should be accounted for, going either toward expenses, debt, investments, or savings.

Zero-based budgeting prevents money from slipping through the cracks by assigning a job for every dollar. 

Start with small changes and adjust periodically
Making progress on saving doesn't have to entail big, sweeping restrictions on your spending. Even small changes can have big results. For instance, if you packed your lunch from home just a few times a week, you could free up hundreds of dollars each month, money you could direct toward savings. Other ways to save include canceling subscriptions you never use, swapping a pricey gym membership for a home setup, or using the library instead of buying books.

Make sure to track how much money you're saving with these small changes so you can see how quickly they add up. 

5. Reduce your spending
One of the easiest ways to save more money is to cut back on your current spending. Every dollar you don't spend is a dollar you can save. Consider some of these ways to free up money for savings.

Start meal planning
While inflation has impacted all areas of your budget, food prices have risen much more than other categories—23% between April 2020 and April 2024.1 Meal planning can help you reduce last-minute takeout orders and impulse grocery buys by giving you a weekly road map of your meals. To save time and money, try cooking larger meals so you can pack the leftovers for lunches. Finally, limit dining out to preplanned treats, not everyday splurges.

Review subscriptions, utilities, and other monthly expenses
Recurring monthly expenses are easy to overlook, but they add up. In fact, consumers underestimate by $133 a month how much they're spending on subscriptions, a recent study found.2 Each year, do a full audit of your streaming services, gym memberships, software licenses, and other subscription services. Cancel any you aren't actively using or no longer need. Also, call your utility and mobile phone companies to try and negotiate better rates. These companies may be willing to give you a better deal to keep your business—but you'll only find out if you ask.

Avoid impulse shopping with the 30-day rule
Impulse purchases provide short-term gratification but little long-term joy. They can also put a hole in your budget. Before any nonessential purchase, impose a 30-day waiting period on yourself. If after 30 days you still want the item, buy it. More likely, you'll lose interest. 

6. Review your debt
Is it better to pay off debt or save? While saving for the future is ideal, it probably makes sense to prioritize paying off any high-interest debt first. High-interest debt like credit card balances or personal loans can feel like an anchor weighing down your savings efforts. Once you pay off your high-interest debt, the money you're spending on fees and interest could be going toward your savings instead.

Pay off high-interest credit card debt
Today's credit card interest rates can often be as high as 20%–25%, causing balances to rapidly accumulate interest, making it increasingly difficult to pay off debt. Prioritize debt repayment so you can reallocate funds toward savings sooner. Consider paying off your debts with these approaches:

Snowball method: Pay minimums on everything except the smallest balance of debt. Attack that debt aggressively until it's paid off, and then roll those payments to the next lowest balance.
Avalanche method: Make minimum payments on everything, but pay down additional amounts on debt with the highest interest rate. When that's paid off, do that with the second-highest interest rate.
Lower your student loan payments
If you have federal student loans, consider an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can help make student loan debt more manageable by reducing your monthly payments. IDR plans such as Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) cap payments at a percentage of your discretionary income. They can create some breathing room in your budget if you're having trouble making your payments on the standard 10-year plan. While payments are lower with IDR plans, you could end up paying more interest over the long term, which is a factor you may want to consider before deciding.

Refinance your mortgage
While mortgage rates have risen substantially in recent years, it's still important to periodically review whether refinancing makes sense. If your existing mortgage is well above current rates, refinancing may save you thousands of dollars over the remaining life of the loan. But if rates aren't significantly lower than your current mortgage, you're unlikely to realize any substantial savings to justify the closing costs of a refi. The key is to check rates regularly in case they fall.

7. Automate your savings
One of the most effective ways to ensure you consistently save is to adopt a ""pay yourself first"" mentality. Before the money ever hits your checking account, set up automatic transfers into your savings, investment accounts, retirement, and emergency savings. By removing the temptation to spend it, you'll quickly adapt to living off the remaining funds without noticing the savings contribution.

Set up automatic transfers to your savings account on payday
Configure your bank accounts to sweep money automatically from your checking account into a dedicated savings account each time you get paid. Treating these savings transfers as a recurring bill to yourself makes it nonnegotiable.

Take advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans with automatic payroll deductions
Signing up for your company's 401(k), 403(b), or other retirement plan allows you to automatically funnel money directly from your paycheck into your investments. If you use tax-deductible accounts, you can reduce your taxable income for the year in addition to building your savings. Contribute at least enough to get your employer's match.

Consider using a Health Saving Account or Flexible Spending Account
If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, you may be eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA), which allows you to make tax-deductible contributions, receive tax-free growth, and make tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.3 HSAs can also be used as an additional retirement fund because any money in the account can be used for any purpose without penalty once you reach 65. Meanwhile, a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) lets you set aside money for medical costs through pre-tax payroll deductions.

8. Grow your short-term savings

Where you keep your hard-earned money is just as important as how much you save. If you park your cash in a traditional checking or savings account, you could be missing out on higher interest rates. For example, a money market fund earning 5% on $1,000 will earn $50 more than a non-interest-bearing account.

Explore cash investments to earn higher interest rates so your money can compound faster.

Explore high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit to earn more interest on your savings
For short-term savings you need within the next 3 years, consider using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs) to potentially earn substantially more than regular savings. Keep in mind, however, that some high-yield savings accounts and CDs offer comparable yields, but they may require high deposit minimums over time.

Vanguard offers brokered CDs, which may offer greater flexibility than traditional bank CDs.

Consider opening a separate savings account for specific goals, such as traveling or buying a home
Having distinct savings accounts for different goals makes it easier to work toward those goals. Automatically transfer money from each paycheck into the respective accounts so you aren't tempted to spend money you've earmarked for other priorities.

Explore safe short-term investments like money market funds
For savings you intend to use in the near future, you might consider a money market fund. Money market funds invest in short-term, high-quality fixed-income securities and cash equivalents with a focus on capital preservation and liquidity.

Vanguard's money market funds have a history of strong performance—100% outperformed their peer-group averages over the last 10 years.4 While money market funds don't have FDIC insurance, they may be protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and may offer a potentially attractive yield that can help your savings grow faster than they would in a typical savings account.

9. Invest your long-term savings
In addition to how much you save, how you invest your money also matters. While asset allocation depends on individual goals, diversifying across stocks, bonds, and cash can help you manage risk and capitalize on different market opportunities over time. How much you invest is based on your needs for retirement or other goals.

Many financial professionals recommend investing at least 10% of your gross income in tax-advantaged retirement accounts to potentially replace 70%–80% of your preretirement income.

Take advantage of your employer's match
Even if you can't max out your 401(k) plan contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer's full matching amount. Some companies match 100% of your contribution (up to a certain amount) and some match only a part. For example, your company may match 50% of your contribution up to 6% of your salary. In other words, if you earn $100,000 annually, they'd match the first $6,000 you contribute with an additional $3,000.

This is free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings over time. By not taking advantage of employer match, you're leaving a valuable company benefit on the table.

Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts
Tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as 401(k) or 403(b) plans, traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and Roth IRAs help you grow your long-term savings while saving on taxes. Contributions to traditional 401(k) plans and IRAs can be tax-deductible, which reduces your taxable income today. Or make contributions to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plans using after-tax money in exchange for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.5

In 2025, the maximum contribution allowed to 401(k)s or 403(b)s is $23,500 and to IRAs is $7,000. If you're 50 or over, those limits increase to $31,000 and $8,000, respectively.

Explore low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds for diversified exposure to the market
Low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a simple and cost-effective way to diversify your market exposure. Rather than picking individual stocks, these funds track major indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, giving you exposure to hundreds (or even thousands) of companies in different sectors with just one purchase. With the proliferation of index funds and ETFs, it's easier than ever to build a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, domestic and international holdings with these low-cost investments.

Consider this: The average investor pays just 0.05% in fees per year to invest in a domestic stock fund, but 0.42% to invest in actively managed funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, which tracks the mutual fund industry.6 Similarly, the average investor in an index ETF pays 0.15% in fees per year, but those in actively managed ETFs pay 0.43%.

Consider a financial advisor for personalized investment advice
While many people successfully invest on their own, some people may prefer working with a financial advisor who can give them professional guidance tailored to their specific situation. If you're looking for personalized advice at a lower cost, automated portfolio management may offer the support you need to achieve your financial goals.

10. Maximize your savings with cash investments

Investing for long-term goals like retirement is crucial, but it's also important to keep some of your savings accessible in cash vehicles for near-term needs and emergencies. Cash investments like money market funds, CDs, and cash management accounts can also help to lower the overall risk of an investment portfolio.

Vanguard provides several cash solutions to help maximize the earning potential of your savings, including money market funds, CDs, and cash management accounts.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/how-to-save,
,How to manage debt: tips to improve financial wellness,"What is debt?
Debt is any money that you owe to someone else, typically because of borrowing to finance a purchase or cover expenses. Debt comes in various forms, including credit card balances, student loans, mortgages, and personal loans.

For most people, debt is a necessary tool to help cover life's big expenses, whether you're purchasing a home, paying for college, or financing a new car. But it's important to understand how different kinds of debt work, especially when it comes to interest rates—which are the primary determinant of the cost of borrowing.

Before taking on a new debt, it's best to consider whether you really need to borrow—and avoid borrowing for unnecessary purchases, like luxuries.

When you need access to credit, explore lower-interest options first. Average interest rates on personal loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) tend to be much lower than interest rates on credit cards or payday loans—which are typically double digits or higher.

High-interest debt can accumulate quickly, due to the monthly interest charges. Interest charges on debt compound by adding the interest to the principal amount you owe, so you end up paying interest on the interest. And as your overall debt load adds up, it can take longer for you to pay off.

I think it’s clearer and more accurate to say that interest rates are the primary determinant of the cost of borrowing (since there are also fees that could add up and, on a short-term loan, end up costing more than the interest charges).

Review your budget and finances
To build an effective plan for tackling your debt, begin by reviewing your debts and your income, then come up with a budgeting and payment strategy.

1. Create a list of all your debts.
List the interest rates, balances, and minimum monthly payments for all your debts. Compare this list with your income and look for ways to prioritize paying off your debt. If possible, work to lower your other expenses so you can put more money toward paying down debt.

2. Find a budgeting method that works for you.

Dealing with debt can be overwhelming and make it difficult to meet your financial obligations, stay on track to achieve future goals, and live a financially healthy life. If you want to put a plan in place but you're not sure where to start, we've got you covered.

The zero-based budget method is good for people who want to get into the details and see where every dollar is spent. Each month you start your budget from zero dollars. For every dollar you spend, you have to justify the expenditure to yourself. As you give each dollar a job—whether it's housing, groceries, or entertainment—the objective is to reduce or even get rid of the things that don't align with your goals. And if you cut something from your budget, you can save more as a result. Over the course of the month, track how well you did. When the next month begins, you start from zero all over again.

The envelope method can work well for people who don't like tracking every single expense. You start with a stack of envelopes and label them with expense categories such as housing, groceries, utilities, etc. Then you put the amount of cash you expect to spend in each category into that envelope. You can label one envelope as savings. At the end of the month, review and adjust the amounts based on your spending. This method helps visualize where your money goes and encourages saving.

Another widely used method is the 50/30/20 rule. With this strategy, you'd allocate no more than 50% of your budget to necessities like food, housing, utilities, childcare, clothing, and minimum loan payments. Up to 30% can be used for purchases like travel, entertainment, technology upgrades, luxury items, and dining out. Ideally you could devote at least 20% of your budget to debt repayment and savings.

50/30/20 is a helpful guide, but depending on your cost-of-living expenses and your individual goals, the exact breakdown for you may vary.

3. Set up an emergency fund.
Having funds set aside for an emergency—anything from a car repair to an unexpected vet bill—can help protect against financial shocks that might otherwise threaten your long-term financial well-being. Many people find themselves adding to debt when an unplanned expense pops up and they don't have the savings to cover it. So if you don't have an emergency fund in place, it's a good idea to start setting money aside for this purpose.

Determine your debt payoff strategy
There are 2 common approaches to paying off debt: avalanche and snowball.

Debt avalanche method
This strategy prioritizes paying off your debt with the highest interest rate first, while continuing to make the minimum payments on all your other debts.

Once your highest-rate debt is paid off, transfer your payments to your second-highest-rate debt until that loan is also paid off. Continue until you've paid off all your prioritized debts.

This strategy aims to minimize your total interest paid, keeping more money in your pocket in the long term. To pay off debt even sooner, consider taking advantage of onetime windfalls—like tax refunds or work bonuses—and applying those to your debt as well.

Debt snowball method
This approach involves paying off the loan with the smallest balance first while making minimum payments on your other debts. After the loan with the lowest balance is paid off, allocate your payments to the next lowest balance. Continue this until all your balances are paid off.

The snowball strategy is geared toward helping you rack up ""mental wins"" as you pay off small debts and check them off your list. For some people, having fewer overall outstanding debts helps reduce stress and give them more confidence to tackle their remaining balances.

With both strategies, it's a good idea to find out what your minimum payments are, verify that your budget allows you to consistently pay that minimum, and set up automatic payments to help ensure you never miss a payment deadline. This can help you avoid paying higher interest rates and fees in the short run.


Debt consolidation
If you're carrying a significant amount of debt, you might consider debt consolidation. This involves combining multiple debts into a single loan, often with a lower interest rate. You take out a new loan to pay off your existing debts, leaving you with just one monthly payment to manage. This can simplify your finances and potentially save you money on interest charges.

Balance debt payment with investing
We believe that you should first prioritize paying off any high-interest debt like credit cards . That's because high-interest debt can grow quickly and cost you more money over time.

High-interest debt, like credit card balances, can make it harder to save and achieve your financial goals. By focusing on these debts first, you can reduce the total amount you pay and improve your financial wellness faster.

For debt with a comparatively low interest rate, it's a good idea to compare the interest rate against the rate of return you hope to achieve with your investments. If the interest rate is lower than your projected rate of return, consider putting more of your money toward investing. If it's higher, it might be better to allocate more money toward decreasing your debt.

As you review your budget and choose a strategy, remember that with planning and patience, it's possible to pay off your debts over time.

,Jump-start your financial planning for the new year,"Pay off debt
Debt comes in many forms—mortgages, college loans, credit cards, and auto loans, to name a few. But one thing remains the same: The interest you pay on your debt can add up quickly, so it's important to plan to pay it off as soon as you can. There are many strategies for paying off debt, but here are 2 common approaches to consider:

The avalanche method prioritizes paying off your highest-rate debt first while making minimum payments on all your other debts. Once you pay off your highest-rate debt, transfer your payments to your second-highest-rate debt until it's also paid off. Then continue this until you've paid off all your prioritized debts.
The snowball method involves paying off the lowest balance first while making minimum payments on your remaining debts. After your lowest balance is paid off, allocate your payments to the next lowest balance. Continue this until you've paid off all your balances.
The key is to find what works for you and stick with it.


Build an emergency savings
It's important to have an emergency fund in place to cover unexpected financial hardships, including a job loss, a medical emergency, home repairs, or car troubles. Putting aside at least 3 to 6 months of living expenses is a good rule of thumb. But of course, the more you can save, the better. If you're struggling to get started, begin with a small amount and build up your savings over time. Remember that as little as $50 a month gives you $600 in annual savings.


Make a plan to fund your goals
What are your financial goals for this year? Do you want to save for a down payment on a house, your retirement, or a child's education? Once you know your goals, you can create a plan to fund them. It may involve setting a budget, increasing your income, or investing your money. Mapping out your plan is as easy as asking yourself 5 questions.

,Charitable giving: How to strategize your donations,"What is charitable giving?

Giving to charity is a profoundly personal and emotional act—it's rewarding to help individuals, communities, and causes we care about. But when it comes to taxes, what's the official definition of a charitable contribution? According to the IRS, it's ""a donation or gift to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. It is voluntary and is made without getting, or expecting to get, anything of equal value.""1

Over the past few years, charitable giving has been strong; in 2023, U.S. charitable donations given by individuals totaled nearly $558 billion.2 The generosity of Vanguard investors and people all over the world continually inspires me, and I'm honored to support and guide my clients toward their philanthropic goals. But one mistake I see clients make is that they sometimes fall short of their charitable goals because they don't plan their giving in advance.

Why do charitable donations need a strategy?

Just like saving for any long-term goal, charitable donations need a strategy, and Vanguard's a trusted partner when it comes to financial strategy. In fact, 3 times as many investors report having peace of mind about investing because of their advisor.3 So let's help you build a formal plan and update it each year. It can help you meet your charitable goals while maximizing available tax savings.

Here are 6 long-term strategies I often share with my clients to help them make the most of their charitable giving.

1. Donate appreciated securities instead of cash
It's easy to donate cash. But by giving appreciated securities, you can give more money to your charities and less to taxes. This is because you won't have to pay capital gains taxes and your charities don't have to pay taxes when they sell them.

For example, if you wanted to give $10,000, you could give it as a cash gift. But if you have a stock fund whose value has increased by $10,000, consider donating the fund instead. You won't owe capital gains tax on the security, you'll still receive a charitable deduction, and you'll meet your giving goals—possibly having paid less out of pocket.


2. Carry over your annual deduction limits for up to 5 years
Generally, you can't deduct more than 60% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year for your cash donations. Contributions of appreciated securities to a charitable organization are limited to 30% of your AGI. But if you want to give more, you can carry forward charitable giving above annual deduction limits for up to 5 years.  

A donor-advised fund (DAF) is another great tool if you're making multiple donations at once. With a DAF, you can set aside money for charity by making deposits into the account and claiming a deduction in the first tax year. You can then invest the money and pay it out to charities over time. A DAF can improve any charitable donation strategy, and by working with one of our advisors, you can see if it aligns with your personal giving goals.  

3. ""Bunch"" your charitable contributions
Bunching charitable contributions is the practice of making larger-than-normal charitable donations in one year to maximize the tax benefits. This can be done if you're on the fence between taking the standard deduction or itemizing your deductions on your tax return. If you itemize deductions, you can deduct charitable contributions up to a certain amount based on your adjusted gross income (AGI) and the type of donation (cash vs. appreciated securities). By bunching your charitable contributions in one year, you can increase your itemized deductions and lower your taxable income.

For example, let's say you normally donate $1,000 to charity each year. If you itemize deductions, you can deduct this amount from your taxable income. However, if you bunch your charitable contributions and donate $2,000 in one year, you can deduct that amount from your taxable income. Depending on the amount of your donation, this could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in taxes.

Of course, there are some things to keep in mind when bunching charitable contributions. First, you need to make sure you have the money to make the larger donation. Second, you need to make sure the charity you're donating to is a qualified organization. Finally, you need to get a written acknowledgment from the charity for each donation. If you're considering bunching charitable contributions, you should talk to a financial advisor to see if it's the right strategy for you.

4. Consider qualified charitable distributions if you're 73
When you reach age 73, you'll have to start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) each year from your retirement accounts.4

If you're not itemizing your deductions and you've reached RMD age, you may want to consider donating your RMD to a qualified charity through a qualified charitable distribution (QCD).5 It'll satisfy your RMD, and—as of 2024—up to $105,000 annually won't count as taxable income. Our financial advisors have the experience and expertise to help you figure out if this approach can provide value for you.

5. Spread charitable giving throughout the year
While most charities receive the bulk of their donations during the year-end ""Season of Giving,"" many organizations need funds year-round. Giving consistently throughout the year—rather than giving a larger onetime donation—can help with this. It may also help you budget for a bigger gift overall. A Vanguard financial advisor can help you automate your gifting by setting up an automatic withdrawal plan for your QCDs to run monthly, quarterly, or whenever works best for you. It's one of the many benefits of investing with Vanguard. Our advisors are here to plan and prepare with you, providing financial strategies customized to your specific goals, needs, and situation.

6. Name a charity as a beneficiary or leave a bequest in your will or trust
Thinking about what may happen after you're gone isn't anyone's favorite topic. However, I often encourage my clients to consider building charitable bequests into their estate plans if they're worried about giving too much too early.

Look at this as an opportunity to create a legacy of giving. Naming a charity as a beneficiary or leaving a bequest in your will or trust allows you to give to causes meaningful to you without overextending yourself if you need to spend more on long-term care or other expenses. Additionally, charitable bequests are eligible for estate tax deduction and can reduce estate taxes.

,Top 6 tips: Your year-end financial checklist,"As you close out 2024 and prepare for the year ahead, we're here with ways to help you maximize your savings, minimize your tax bill, and stay on track with your financial goals.

1. Max out your retirement contributions for 2024
There's still time to make 2024 contributions to your retirement accounts. You have until:

December 31, 2024, to contribute to your employer plan (SIMPLE and SEP-IRA contributions are allowed until the extension date if one is filed).
The April 2025 tax-filing deadline to contribute to your traditional or Roth IRAs.
Don't forget, your IRA contributions can't exceed either your earned income for the year or the IRS-imposed limits, whichever amount is less.

Depending on your retirement account, you may be eligible for some additional tax deductions. Traditional employer-plan contributions generally come out of your pay on a pre-tax basis, which automatically reduces your taxable income. But IRA contributions work a little differently. While Roth IRA contributions are never tax-deductible, traditional IRA deductions vary based on your modified adjusted gross income and whether you're covered by a retirement plan at work. Check out the 2024 IRA deduction limits to see if you qualify. 

2. Take your required minimum distribution (RMD)
If you're required to take your RMD, you'll want to act before the end of the year to avoid paying a penalty. If you turned 73 this year and are taking an RMD for the first time, you have until April 1, 2025, to withdraw your RMD. After that, you'll need to take it before the end of each calendar year.

The IRS requires you to take RMDs from certain types of retirement accounts, such as traditional IRAs and qualified retirement accounts from a former employer. If you're required to take an RMD, Vanguard will automatically calculate your RMD amount each year.

If you inherited an IRA on or after January 1, 2020, you might be subject to the new 10-year rule. This means the account must be liquidated by the end of the 10th year following the year of the original owner's death. The penalty for not taking a distribution in 2024 is waived for this year, so you can skip taking an RMD if you'd like. But the account must still be liquidated at the end of the 10th year (meaning you might have to take more out later). This penalty waiver only applies to inherited IRAs following the 10-year rule.

3. Reach your 529 education savings goals with a 2024 contribution
You have until December 31 to contribute to most states' 529 education plans to qualify for a 529 plan tax deduction or credit. However, plans administered in Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin allow you to contribute until April 15 of the following year. And Iowa allows for contributions through April 30, 2025.

529 plans are a great way to give the gift of education while reaping tax benefits too.  

· You can contribute up to $18,000 in 2024 for single filers ($36,000 if married filing jointly) per beneficiary without triggering the federal gift tax.

· You may be able to deduct your contributions from your state income tax (or get a state tax credit) depending on where you live.1

· If you want to contribute more to a 529 account in a single year, you can ""superfund"" the account without it counting against your lifetime gift tax exemption. By superfunding a 529, you can make up to 5 years' worth of contributions ($90,000 for 2024) all at once to reduce your taxable estate.

Note: You can also make unlimited payments directly to educational institutions on behalf of others for qualified expenses without incurring a taxable gift or affecting your $18,000 gift exclusion. This method is a great way to help a loved one pay for their education.

For example, say you wanted to pay your grandchild's $50,000 tuition for her medical degree. You could pay the university directly for their tuition and still give them an additional $18,000 tax-free. This strategy reduces your taxable estate and helps preserve your lifetime gift and estate exemption.

4. Complete a Roth conversion by December 31, 2024
You have until the end of this year to complete a Roth conversion for the 2024 tax year.

Roth IRAs offer many benefits—including tax-free growth and tax-free distributions—assuming you're age 59½ and you've held the account for at least 5 years. There are also no RMDs, making it easier to leave a tax-free inheritance to your heirs. But there are some additional tax considerations to keep in mind when considering a conversion. Here are a few to look at.

A conversion is a taxable event
When converting assets from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, there are no income restrictions and you don't have to convert the entire amount at once. Since you'll owe ordinary income taxes on any pre-tax amounts, partial conversions make it easier to spread out your tax payments over 2 or more years. To avoid paying a higher tax rate, you may want to consider converting an amount that keeps you in your desired tax bracket. Depending on your home state, you may also have to pay state income taxes on a conversion.

Timing matters
Deciding when to convert often hinges on whether your tax rate will be higher now or in the future. If you believe your tax rate is lower now than it will be when you start taking withdrawals, a conversion may be beneficial because you'll pay conversion income taxes now—while you're in a lower tax bracket—and enjoy tax-free Roth IRA withdrawals later—when the higher tax bracket won't matter.

It's also important to note that tax rates are set to rise when the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires at the end of 2025. So if you've been putting off a Roth conversion, those rising tax rates may make this a good time to get the conversion process started.

Ways to manage conversion taxes
If you're 73 or older, you'll need to satisfy your RMD before converting, which will result in a taxable event. However, taking advantage of a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) can help ease the overall tax burden associated with a conversion.

Tax deductions for charitable contributions and tax credits that might otherwise be carried into future years can also help offset the taxes generated by a conversion. The IRS requires you to aggregate all your IRAs—regardless of which accounts you're converting—for the purpose of calculating the taxable basis.


5. Take advantage of charitable giving tax benefits
Charitable giving offers a way to financially support your favorite charities while enjoying tax benefits that accompany your generosity.

Charitable tax deductions
For charitable donations made by December 31, 2024, you can deduct up to 60% of your 2024 adjusted gross income (AGI) for cash gifts made to a qualifying charity (which excludes private foundations and supporting organizations). The deduction is usually limited to 30% of your AGI for noncash contributions such as appreciated stock gifts and donations to qualifying private foundations or organizations.

Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs)
If you're 70½ or older, you can take up to $105,000 annually from your traditional IRA to donate directly to a qualified charity without paying taxes—the QCD is simply excluded from your taxable income. If you're age 73 and don't need to live off your RMD income, the benefit is twofold—it can help you meet your RMD requirement and reap the tax benefits. You may have to withdraw more depending on your actual RMD amount.

Note: If you make a QCD, you won't be able to claim a charitable deduction with those same assets.

The Secure Act 2.0—signed into law in December 2022—includes a onetime election for a QCD to a split-interest entity. This allows you to make a QCD of up to $53,000 to fund either a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT), charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT), or charitable gift annuity (CGA). Consult your tax advisor and estate planner to see if this makes sense for you.


6. Check your financial health
The end of the year is a good time to make sure you're up to date on the following:

Update beneficiaries if necessary.
If open enrollment/Medicare open enrollment is still open, review your elections and update if needed.
Check out year-end fund estimates for capital gains.

FAQs

Should I consolidate my investment accounts?
Consolidating your investment accounts can be a great way to simplify your recordkeeping, develop appropriate goals, and help reduce fees. In addition, holding your assets at multiple institutions can make it harder for your heirs to process your estate, and varying paperwork requirement and timelines can lead to errors and pressure on your loved ones. By bringing your assets to Vanguard, you can help reduce the complexity of estate transition for your heirs.


How could consolidating my accounts help with taxes?
Holding all your assets at one institution could simplify your tax process. Instead of receiving tax forms from multiple institutions, you'd be able to access them all in one convenient location. Your relationship manager will be able to talk with you and your tax advisor together to streamline the process even more.


What else could my relationship manager help with?
Your relationship manager could also help with your philanthropic planning. When it comes to estate planning, philanthropic giving can be advantageous for those with high-net-worth portfolios. We can help you explore the most tax-efficient ways to give and make the process as easy as possible. And when you donate through a donor-advised fund like Vanguard Charitable, it can help reduce the tax obligation of your estate.

,Building wealth using 529s for K-12 education,"Expanded use of 529s
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expanded the Qualified Tuition Program (QTP) rules to allow 529 plans to be used for primary and secondary (K–12) education. These changes allow investors to withdraw up to $10,000 per year or the cost of tuition, whichever is less, to pay for K–12 tuition without incurring federal taxes or penalties.1

Most states also have adopted the federal tax law and allow 529 plan assets to be withdrawn for K–12 tuition without incurring state taxes or penalties, and many states also offer tax deductions or credits for 529 contributions. Eleven states, however, do not consider K–12 tuition a qualified expense.2 In these states, withdrawing funds for K–12 tuition may incur taxes or penalties at the state level.

Opportunity to generate additional wealth through tax savings
To measure some of the benefit of using a 529 plan for K–12 tuition expenses, Kane, Kahler, and Hassett built a model to estimate the excess wealth a hypothetical investor can generate by investing in a 529 instead of a taxable brokerage account.

The authors found that using a 529 plan for K–12 tuition expenses can generate additional wealth through tax savings, particularly for investors who start saving early and reside in a state with favorable tax treatment for K–12 withdrawals. Specifically, the average additional wealth created over 18 years of investing in states that offer a tax deduction is more than 2.5 times the savings in states that do not offer one or in states that penalize K–12 withdrawals.

But what’s interesting is that (with the exception of Minnesota), using a 529 for K–12 tuition can generate additional wealth even in states that penalize using 529s for this purpose. “A big reason for this is the tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals at the federal level,” said Kane, a Vanguard investment analyst. ""This is especially the case for those who start early in the beneficiary’s life, as it allows them to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.”

While our model shows additional wealth creation through tax savings even in most states that impose a penalty, the model relies on a specific set of contribution and investment assumptions. Investors should consult a tax professional before using a 529 plan for K–12 tuition given the nuances involved in each state’s tax code.

Additional wealth created by state over 18 years by using a 529 plan for K–12 tuition 

Saving for post-secondary education expenses should still be the priority
After measuring the hypothetical benefit of using a 529 plan for K–12 tuition, the team looked at how real-life investors are actually using 529s to pay for K–12 tuition.

The research found that while investors making withdrawals for K–12 tuition were contributing more on average, the contributions were often not enough to both offset withdrawals and build college savings. As a result, these account balances were generally significantly lower compared with those of investors not using the account to pay for K–12 tuition. This was particularly true for those who opened accounts after the federal tax law changed in 2017.

Our findings suggest that investors may be prioritizing the short-term benefits of using these accounts for K–12 tuition, potentially at the expense of their post-secondary education savings goals. (Note that 529 assets may also be used to pay for other types of post-secondary education, like vocational schools or trade schools.)

Because one of the most valuable benefits of a 529 plan is tax-deferred growth, Kahler said that using the account to save for post-secondary education expenses should remain the priority as this goal has a longer time horizon and therefore can generate more additional wealth over time.

,Your financial checklist for starting a new job,"Planned vs. unplanned transitions
While the following items are important to consider during a career transition, it's important to note that not everyone's path looks the same. Someone who's had time to plan may be in a different place emotionally and financially than someone who was unexpectedly laid off. 

Your path to getting a new job—whether planned or unplanned—is important to consider because of the effect it may have on your finances. Once you've started your career transition, the following financial checklist can help you kick off your new job with confidence.

Set up direct deposit
Ensure your salary is conveniently and securely deposited into your bank account so you always have easy access to your earnings. Contact your new employer's HR department to provide your bank details. 

Understand your employee benefits
Existing benefits: When you're transitioning to a new job, it's important to take note of the benefits that do and don't carry over. If you have any benefits you can't take with you when you leave your employer—like unused time off or savings from your flexible spending account (FSA)—use them to the best of your ability before you leave.

Retirement benefits: Many employers offer an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k), which can be a valuable retirement savings tool. They may also match a portion of your contributions, so ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of your company's match program. If you don't choose what to invest in, your new plan's sponsor may select a default option—like a target-date fund—for you. So, review your investments and make sure they align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

If you have an existing retirement plan from your previous employer, you can keep it with them or roll it over into your new employer's plan. You also have the option of rolling it into a Vanguard IRA® or an IRA at another broker. Remember to keep track of where those savings are so you don't leave them behind when planning for retirement.

Before you decide what to do with your old retirement plan, carefully consider the fees, investment options, and your long-term financial goals. You should also take time to review your vesting schedule, stock options, and deadlines for making taxable elections to accounts held with both your former and new employers. If you're not sure where to begin, you may find it beneficial to work with an advisor who can help you weigh your options, understand the impact of different choices, and choose the one that's best for you.

Health benefits: Enrolling in your new employer's health insurance plan is crucial for safeguarding your health and finances. Compare the available plans, considering factors such as coverage, deductibles, copays, and network providers. Select the plan that best suits your health needs and budget. If you currently have a health savings account (HSA), understand its transfer options, plan details, and overall tax benefits.

If you're not yet employed and are under age 65, you may be eligible to continue your employer-based health coverage—usually for 18 months—under COBRA. Keep in mind that extending your health care plan through COBRA is often more expensive than the cost of your current coverage because you may have to pay both the premium and any insurance subsidy your employer previously paid.

Insurance benefits: Your employer may also offer life insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance. These benefits can help provide financial protection for you and your loved ones in case of unexpected events. Assess your needs, explore out-of-pocket costs, and consider enrolling in the appropriate insurance plans to ensure you have the right coverage.

Lastly, update your beneficiaries as necessary for retirement, insurance, and estate purposes. Reviewing this information and ensuring it matches your current life circumstances can set you up for success during any life transition. 

Manage your goals
Reviewing your personal budget will help you see how much you earn, spend, and save, and may provide opportunities to reduce your expenses and boost your savings. If your new job comes with a higher salary, you might be tempted to splurge. However, it's important to continue living within your means and avoid taking on any unnecessary debt. Consider allocating part of your increased income to get closer to your financial goals. If your salary doesn't change much, you can still benefit from reviewing and updating your budget and ensuring your expenses don't exceed your income.

In addition to creating or reviewing your budget, it's also important to revisit your emergency fund. An emergency fund is a savings account you can tap into in case of unexpected financial events, such as a job loss or medical emergency. The size of your emergency fund depends on your individual financial situation. However, a good rule of thumb is to save enough money to cover at least 3 to 6 months of living expenses. If you don't have an emergency fund already, or if your fund is low, make it a priority to contribute to it regularly until you reach your goal.

Finally, it's important to assess how an increase or decrease in income affects planning for competing goals like saving for education or a home and caring for aging parents. This may differ based on the stage of life you're in when you change jobs. Typically, those who are younger have a higher risk tolerance, whereas those nearing retirement age may be focused on conserving their existing savings.

Consider consolidating your investments
When you roll over your retirement savings to one provider, you can get a more holistic view of your investment portfolio and make informed decisions based on your asset mix, diversification, and other applicable factors. You can easily monitor investment performance, identify opportunities, and rebalance as necessary. A centralized platform can also help you track your IRA contributions and calculate your required minimum distributions (RMDs) accurately.

Consolidating your assets also reduces the need to juggle multiple statements and accounts from different providers. In addition to receiving fewer and more streamlined tax forms, you can easily track your income, expenses, and investments—making tax preparation and reporting less tedious. You may also benefit from lower costs and other benefits, including access to financial advisors who can assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals to help you make more informed investment decisions.

Personalized advice can be especially valuable during significant life changes. Our advisors can help you understand the impact a career change can have on your finances and offer support and guidance to help you stay on track toward your long-term financial goals.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/financial-checklist-for-starting-a-new-job,
,5 financial behaviors to boost your financial health,"5 behaviors investors are prioritizing 

1.Balancing saving for multiple goals
57% of households are saving for 3+ goals.2

Sticking to a budget is an important step if you're planning to put your money toward multiple goals. Over the past 2 years, inflation has put a strain on budgets, making it harder to pay down debts and save. One technique that can work as a helpful budgeting guide is the 50/30/20 rule. Give it a try to ensure you're setting aside money to efficiently pay off debts and save.

Whether you're saving for a child's education, a down payment on a house, your retirement, or something else, it's important to turn your goals into an investment plan. A simple way to get started is to automate your savings by having money automatically transferred into your account on a set schedule.   


2.Taking advantage of debt-reduction strategies
Many investors are prioritizing strategies to efficiently pay off high-interest loans.

When inflation and interest rates are high, it's important to focus on paying off debts with high interest rates first. But for debt with a comparatively low interest rate, it's a good idea to compare the debt's interest rate against the rate of return you hope to achieve with your investments.

Here are some tips to help you:

Build an effective plan to tackle debt.
Determine a payoff strategy that works to minimize total interest paid or get some quick wins under your belt.  

3.Building an emergency fund
Creating a financial safety net for unexpected expenses has become a top priority for Americans. In fact, 52% of U.S. households prioritize building an emergency fund as their top goal, even as they juggle the demands of multiple goals.2

To maximize your long-term growth potential, consider splitting your savings between cash and investments. For example, investing a portion of your emergency savings in an accessible, broadly diversified ETF (exchange-traded fund) with minimal tax consequences can help you keep up with inflation. These supplemental savings could come in handy if you lose your job or experience a break in your income.3

4.Keeping taxes low
Investors are actively seeking tax-efficient strategies to minimize their tax liability. This includes using tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s to shelter their retirement savings from the regular pinch of taxes through tax-deferred growth.4 Automated tax-loss harvesting5 is an effective tax strategy that can help turn market volatility into a tax-savings opportunity. 


5.Managing volatility
Market volatility is a normal, expected part of investing. And it's a big reason why so many investors hold a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.  

While you can't predict when volatility will strike, there are things you can do to help stay on the path to long-term success. It's about focusing on things within your control like:

Diversifying your portfolio. Investing across different asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions can help reduce the impact of market risk on overall investment returns. ETFs or funds that seek to track broad market indexes offer a great way to get broad exposure to the entire U.S. and International stock and bond market.
Rebalancing your portfolio. When one asset class is doing better than others, your portfolio could become unaligned with your target asset allocation. To ensure your portfolio stays aligned with your risk tolerance and asset allocation, we recommend checking it at least once a year. And if your mix is off by at least 5 percentage points, consider rebalancing so you don't drift off course.

,10 things that may surprise you about 529s,"Thinking about opening a 529?
Here are 10 things you should know (and a few might surprise you).
1. 529s aren’t just for 4-year colleges
While many high school graduates go on to attend traditional universities, some have different plans for their future, like attending trade school or studying abroad. Whatever higher education looks like for them, a 529 plan can help fund it. Some 529 plans also allow for assets to be used toward K–12 tuition or fees of up to $10,000 per student per year at a public, private, or religious school.2


2. 529s pay for more than just tuition
Your investment can be used to pay for tuition, room and board, books, supplies, and other qualified expenses at any accredited vocational school, college, or graduate school in the U.S. or abroad.


3. Excess 529 funds can be converted to Roth IRA savings
With SECURE 2.0, unused 529 funds can be used for retirement too. Account owners can incrementally roll over a lifetime maximum of $35,000 (following annual rollover limits) tax- and penalty-free to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary.1


4. You can transfer the plan to a family member
You can change the account beneficiary anytime as long as they’re a qualified family member. For example, if a child decides not to go to college after high school, the money can go to someone else, like a sibling, stepchild, or parent who has plans to attend in the future.


5. Almost anyone can open a 529 (hey, Grandma!)
Parents aren't the only ones who can open a 529 plan and start saving. Almost anyone can, including grandparents, other relatives, and friends. But did you know that grandparents can fund a 529 without impacting financial aid eligibility? It's true—thanks to a streamlined FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form that eliminates questions about grandparent contributions.


6. You can open a 529 account for yourself
If you have plans to go back to school, you can open a 529 account for yourself. Yes, the account owner and beneficiary of the savings account can be the same person. Up to $10,000 from a 529 plan can also be used for student loan repayment.3 What better way to invest in your future?


7. Anyone can contribute to a 529
After a 529 account is opened, everyone can contribute—friends, family, neighbors, or anyone who wants to help—via cash, check, or electronic transfer. And with The Vanguard 529 Plan, family and friends can also use Ugift® to easily contribute $50 or more online. They just choose the amount they want to give, and it's deposited directly into the account. It's the perfect way to celebrate (think birthdays, showers, and graduations).


8. A beneficiary can have multiple accounts
More than one account can be opened on behalf of the same beneficiary. For example, if a grandmother already opened a 529 for a grandchild, the child's parent can open one too. They're both saving for future education expenses and still eligible for state tax deductions.


9. Some plans allow for automatic, recurring contributions
Once a Vanguard 529 is open, it's easy to schedule automatic, recurring contributions. And the monthly minimum contribution is only $50, which you can increase at any time. Here are some simple ways to save more money each year:

Set up automatic yearly contribution increases.
Use part of a work bonus or tax refund to make a onetime contribution.
Reminder: You should continue monitoring your asset allocation to ensure it still aligns with your goals.


10. You can leave your investments to the experts or DIY
The Vanguard 529 Plan has options to suit how you approach investing. Hands-on investors can strategize and choose an asset mix that fits their timeline and risk tolerance. If you'd rather not manage your investments, you can consider a Target Enrollment Portfolio instead, which automatically adjusts to become more conservative as your beneficiary approaches their enrollment date. 

Is The Vanguard 529 Plan right for you?
More than 350,000 families nationwide have chosen The Vanguard 529 Plan to invest in more than half a million futures.4 With The Vanguard 529, investors get access to high-quality investment options and low costs over the life of the plan, leaving more money to put toward education. In fact, our costs are among the lowest in the industry.

Already know you want to open a Vanguard 529?
When you're ready to start saving, you can open a Vanguard 529 online. You'll just need these 3 things:

Basic information: Make sure you have the beneficiary's Social Security number, birth date, and address. By the way, parents-to-be can open an account and add their child's Social Security number later.
Investment choices: Consider a Target Enrollment Portfolio based on the year closest to when your beneficiary expects to start attending school or assemble an investment strategy from our individual portfolios.

,Money and marriage: Building a financial future together,"Money and relationships aren't always a perfect pair, which can sometimes add to the financial stress 74% of Americans already feel.1 With more than half of Americans admitting they couldn't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, the idea of doing more financially is daunting.2 Fortunately, there are some benefits to joining financial forces with your life partner. A healthy financial partnership starts with an open and honest conversation, and with some planning and help from tech tools, you can achieve more financially with less effort and stress.

If you want to learn how to manage finances in a marriage, here are 5 steps to help you align with your partner and move closer to your goals.

Step 1: Sharing your philosophies on money
Sharing your philosophies on money is a great way to understand your partner's views on money. Before you combine your finances, talk about how you save, spend, and invest. What's your investment risk tolerance? Do you prefer bold investments, or would you rather take the safest path possible? Are you a budgeter or a spender? Do you want to live modestly and save aggressively, or do you favor the finer things in life?

Be sure to communicate openly and honestly as you explore the answers to these questions, since this is the first step to laying the foundation of a healthy financial partnership.

Step 2: Getting organized with big-picture goals
Now that you're part of a pair, you need to get organized and start thinking about the big picture and your collective goals. For some, retirement is a distant goal that can take a backseat to saving for a house, seeing the world, or having children. But, if you plan to retire at age 65, you may have to start saving sooner or setting aside more money each year to get you to your goal on time. Maybe you have student loans and credit card debt you'd like to pay off, but if your partner is planning a vacation to celebrate your birthday, your respective goals could conflict. Whatever your big-picture financial goals, you need to get organized and align with your partner on these major milestones.

After you agree on which milestones are most important, create a timeline for achieving those goals. This is where concrete numbers come into the equation, so grab your calculator and determine how much each of you need to contribute to reach your goals. Like your money philosophy, you should be completely open and honest about your big-picture goals to ensure you and your partner work in sync toward your shared aspirations.

Step 3: Building your financial fortress together
Since finances in marriage are largely about hitting your savings goals, a newlywed budget should always include a strategy for tackling debt and establishing an emergency fund. Sometimes, unexpected expenses threaten your financial goals. To help safeguard your financial future, start building your financial fortress together by focusing on the following:

Pay down debt
Debt can weigh you down, and in some situations, it may help to prioritize paying off debt before saving or investing.
Create a debt repayment plan based on interest rates and balances.
Tackle debt with the highest interest rate first (a strategy known as the debt avalanche method).
Establish an emergency fund
Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account to establish a saving routine.
Aim to save enough to cover 6 months of living expenses. This can help support you in the event of a financial emergency or if you find yourself in between jobs.
Consider using Vanguard money market funds or a Vanguard Cash Plus Account to help grow your savings with lower market risk.
Avoid using your emergency fund for non-emergency expenses.
Fund your goals
Make a budget to take control of your finances.
Set aside a portion of each paycheck and use it to fund your goals.
Consider setting up automatic transfers (login required) that directly feed funding your top-prioritized goals.

Step 4: Monitoring your progress and making adjustments
Step 4 in successful money management for couples is about checking in on your progress and making adjustments. You'll grow and change as a couple, and so will your financial goals. A significant life event—like a new job, the birth of a baby, or a financial windfall—is the perfect opportunity to revisit your finances, but you should also regularly monitor your savings and investments. Checking in on your finances periodically gives you the opportunity to:

Celebrate your wins and stay motivated.
Rebalance your investment portfolio and adjust to your evolving risk tolerance.
Reassess your goals and contribution commitments.
Try not to react to market volatility. Historically, staying the course has been beneficial to investors.
Hold each other accountable and ensure you stay on the same page.

Step 5: Automate, relax, and enjoy your life
Financial planning for couples doesn't have to be complicated, expensive, or time consuming. A new marriage is an ideal time to organize your finances, and with tools like Digital Advisor, you can do more with less effort to help achieve better financial outcomes. Digital Advisor can create a personal strategy based on what's right for you and automatically rebalance your investments so you can free up time to focus on what truly matters—enjoying your life together.

,Estate planning basics,"What's estate planning?
Estate planning is the process of creating legal documents to specify how and by whom your assets will be handled in the event of your passing or if you're unable to make decisions for yourself. Many people think that having a will is all that estate planning entails. But it may also involve setting up a trust, and it certainly includes selecting beneficiaries for retirement accounts and life insurance policies, as well as how you title ownership of your assets. 

Here are a few potential foundational documents you might want in your estate plan:

Simple will/Complex will
Revocable living trust
Financial power of attorney/Health care power of attorney
Living will/Advance medical directive
Create an inventory of your assets
First, look at all your assets and their value. You can use our Personal Financial Inventory worksheet (PDF) to take inventory of all your investments, properties, insurance benefits, and other assets. Share it with your family and others helping you, such as your attorney or financial advisor. It's important to put aside any short-term hesitancy to ensure you have a clear plan in place. And remember: Taking inventory of your estate isn't a one-and-done job. You should review your assets every few years and update your plan for any changes that may have occurred.

Consider the basic components of an estate plan
After you've taken inventory and have a sense of what's in your estate, think about how to protect the assets and your family after you're gone. You can start with the documents listed below, but you may also want to consult an attorney or financial advisor to ensure you have what you need for your situation.

Simple and complex wills
Many clients already have a will, which is a set of instructions explaining how property owned in your name should be distributed after your passing. It also names an executor and a guardian if needed. This type of will only takes effect after your death.

Since not all assets are distributed through a will, be sure to review your beneficiary information on insurance policies and retirement plans periodically to make sure everything is up to date. One common mistake is when there's been a divorce and the ex-spouse is still the beneficiary of a client's retirement account. In addition, it's important to make sure any jointly owned assets are titled the way you want, because how assets are titled may take precedence over instructions in a will. 

Revocable living trust
One often overlooked estate planning tool is a trust—they can work for many different income levels. Trusts offer more control and privacy than wills and can help make your estate plan more flexible.

Different types of trusts are available to suit various situations, including:

Blended families.
Assets being passed to grandchildren.
Children with special needs.
Money meant for specific uses.
Assets being passed to several inheritors (like homes or businesses).
Continuity of management during incapacity.
Tax planning.
Financial and health care powers of attorney (POAs)
If there comes a time when you can't make decisions for yourself, it's important to have POAs in place. A POA is a legal document granting a person you trust the authority to act on your behalf. A financial POA manages decisions surrounding your finances, while a health care POA handles decisions regarding your medical care.

Living will and advance medical directive
A living will outlines your preferences concerning medical treatment in terminal situations. Unlike a health care POA—which applies to other areas of medical care—a living will only details instructions concerning end-of-life care.

Ensure your wishes are followed if you can't manage your affairs
One of the most sensitive topics to discuss with clients is what will happen if they become unable to manage their estate plan—whether temporarily or permanently. It's important to have a plan in place so your loved ones can carry out your financial and medical wishes. Having honest conversations now can help provide peace of mind for everyone.

In many cases, people only think about wills when it comes to estate planning. But titling assets, naming beneficiaries, creating trust documents, designating a health care POA, and having an advance medical directive are also vital parts of estate planning. And they should be done with knowledge and care.

Already have an estate plan?
Now might be a good time to review it. An estate plan isn't something you can set and forget. Over time, you want to make sure your intentions haven't changed and you've included the right people. Has there been a marriage or divorce? A birth? A change to your financial situation? A change in domicile or residency?

If it's been 5 years or more, it's time to see if any updates are warranted.
If it's been less than 5 years, it's worth checking whether changes to tax laws could affect your plan.
If you've experienced a major life event, it's worth revisiting your plan.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/estate-planning-basics#revocable-living-trust,
,Year-end charitable giving tips to consider,"Charitable giving: What you should know
Uncertainty can cause people to delay giving decisions. We're all facing an unpredictable environment and you may be wondering what the world will look like in 2024—including how markets will perform and whether the economy will achieve a ""soft landing."" My advice? When it comes to charitable decisions, focus less on what's unknown and more on what we can count on to be true. For example:

You can give back in more ways than one. We often hear our donors tell of the value of their ""time, talent, and treasure."" Volunteering, serving on a board, or offering other expertise in support of charities are wonderful ways to make a difference. For those with a skill in demand—think graphic design, accounting, or social media management—consider reaching out to your favorite nonprofit to see how you can ""donate"" your skills to further their mission.
There are tax benefits associated with giving. For those looking to donate financially, the charitable tax deduction incentive is the same as it's been in recent years and is unlikely to change before year-end. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set to expire at the end of 2025, changes may be on the horizon. For now, however, taxpayers can take advantage of the provisions currently in place.
Financial gifts can go far beyond cash. Remember that what you give may be just as important as how much you give. Despite economic volatility, many assets are close to all-time highs. This means you might own an appreciated or even highly appreciated portfolio. Donating these appreciated assets instead of withdrawing cash could be a financially savvy move. You could also donate illiquid assets such as private equity, hedge fund interests, C corporation stock, real estate, LLCs, limited partnerships, and more. While not all charities can accept illiquid assets, a donor-advised fund provider like Vanguard Charitable can help turn those assets into giving impact. Review your portfolio with a Vanguard advisor (if you're a client of Vanguard Personal Advisor®) to make sure you're maximizing the tax benefit of your charitable gifts.
We're here to help if you need us. Year-end is a critical time to examine your giving options. At Vanguard Charitable, we're focused on making sure our donors and the broader public are supported in meeting their giving goals, so we offer tools and resources to help you make the most of giving.
Our resource, Developing Your Charitable Budget, helps you think through ways to expand your impact. Individuals who make a charitable budget are generally more likely to give and to increase their giving each year.
Our Tax-Savings Calculator can give you an idea of how much you'll save depending on the amount of your charitable donations.*
The third season of our podcast, The Value in Giving, amplifies voices across the world of philanthropy, connecting donors to inspirational nonprofit and industry leaders.
How do you know where to start? Giving Matters: A Guide to Mapping Your Charitable Plan can help donors transform their charitable giving from what may be a scattershot approach to a strategy that is thoughtful, aligned to donor values, and focused on long-term impact.
 

5 end-of-year charitable giving tips
Generally, only donations to a qualified 501(c)(3) charitable organization are eligible for tax deductions. (Vanguard Charitable is a qualified charitable organization, and we ensure that any grants you recommend from your donor-advised fund account go to other qualifying organizations.)
To get the tax deduction, make sure you itemize deductions on your tax return instead of taking the standard deduction. (You'll only want to do this if your itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction.) If your itemized deductions don’t exceed the standard deduction, you can consider “bunching” multiple years’ worth of charitable gifts into one year to maximize your tax benefit.
Although there are limits on your tax deduction (depending on your income and what you're donating), you can deduct excess contributions over the next 5 years.
Strategies like donating appreciated assets (rather than cash) or directing your required minimum distribution to a qualified charity can help you save even more on taxes.
The tax deadline to make donations for 2023 is December 31—but that's a Sunday, so you may want to plan ahead. If you're donating assets other than cash, it can get a bit more complex, and you'll want to initiate the process even sooner.
Use a donor-advised fund or charitable accounts
Once you figure out how much you're giving and which assets you're donating, you might want to think about how you should give—specifically whether you should leverage a giving vehicle of some sort. There are a few different types of giving vehicles—private foundations, donor-advised funds, charitable trusts—and they differ in terms of features and costs. When comparing your options, keep in mind that many giving tools can be used together.

A giving vehicle is one great way to make your giving budget go further. Our Why Giving Matters report, for example, found that Vanguard Charitable donors give more and give more effectively with a donor-advised fund. The purpose of a giving vehicle is simple: to transfer assets to charities in a carefully planned way that makes financial sense and maximizes your charitable impact over time.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/year-end-charitable-giving-tips,
,Four timeless principles for investing success,"1.Create clear, appropriate investment goals
There is no one-size-fits-all plan for reaching financial objectives. Goals are unique to an investor's situation, preferences, and aspirations. Identifying and prioritizing financial intentions allows investors to focus on what matters most, in an order that works for them. It also helps them decide where they’re willing to compromise.

Once investors set and prioritize goals, they can figure out how much—and for how long—they'll need to save. The value any portfolio achieves over time is the sum of two elements: savings (the amount an investor puts into their portfolio) and investment returns. Much of the discussion about investment success tends to focus on investment returns, but both elements are crucial in reaching a goal. Time is a key factor here. For short time horizons, savings—which is within an investor’s control—is the driving force in achieving an investment goal. As the time horizon increases, investment returns increase in importance.

Savings and investment returns both contribute to the achievement of any investment goal
Over any given goal horizon, an investment balance is the sum of savings (the amount an investor puts into the investment portfolio) plus the investment returns on the total amount invested.

2.Keep a balanced and diversified mix of investments
Stocks are risky, but so is avoiding them. Stocks are more volatile in the short run, but historically they've outperformed cash-equivalent assets (PDF) in the long run. By spreading investments across stocks and bonds and among sectors and countries, an investor can reduce overall portfolio volatility while also safeguarding against unnecessarily large losses.

An appropriate asset allocation takes into account an investor’s risk tolerance—how much volatility they can tolerate in their portfolio—and risk capacity—their ability to withstand a loss in their portfolio (a reflection of their time horizon and cash flow needs). Factoring in an investor’s time horizon and their tolerance for risk can lead to a tailored portfolio that’s suitable to personalized situations.

3.Minimize costs
Market movements and financial returns are hard to predict, but costs are often controllable. The two broad types of costs that investors can minimize are (1) taxes and (2) investment costs, which include expense ratios, transaction costs, and sales charges. Together, these costs cut into investment returns, sometimes significantly. To reduce these expenditures, and help improve returns, an investor can:

Seek out lower-cost funds. The evidence is clear: Lower-cost mutual funds have historically outperformed higher-cost mutual funds after costs.1
Implement tax-advantaged and tax-efficient investment strategies, where available. These strategies might include retirement account options, reducing transaction activity, and having a strategic plan for tax-efficient asset location.
4.Maintain perspective and long-term discipline
Discipline in investing is the ability to adhere, over time, to an investment plan. It's natural to want to react to market volatility, but acting on that emotion can lead to an impulsive decision, like panic selling during an unstable market. Taking a long-term perspective can help an investor maintain discipline and avoid a potentially harmful emotional move. 


Staying the course can help increase an investor's chance of success, but so can other actions, like making regular contributions to a portfolio, and increasing them over time.  

Other actions that can increase the likelihood of reaching an investment goal? A consistent plan to rebalance a portfolio, a disciplined spending strategy, and a regularly scheduled date to monitor and review goals.

Our four principles can help investors focus on the aspects within their control, so they can build tailored plans to help them achieve investing success.  ",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/four-timeless-principles-for-investing-success,
,Tips to successfully transfer your wealth,"What's wealth transfer?
Wealth transfer is the process of moving assets from one generation to another. Assets can include investments, real estate, personal property, and anything else you wish to pass down. Wealth transfer is a key part of estate planning and plays a vital role in preserving and growing your family legacy.

Ask yourself this question: ""How prepared are your loved ones to inherit your wealth if something unexpected were to happen tomorrow?"" It's a simple question that reinforces the importance of wealth transfer planning and can be a great motivator to start these important conversations early. Delaying these discussions can lead to frustration and the possible loss of wealth down the road.Wealth transfer tips to set your loved ones up for success
Schedule regular family legacy meetings
The key to success starts with regular communication about your financial intentions. Your family should know what to expect when you pass away, including how they can best protect your wealth and carry out your financial legacy.

If you haven't already, set aside time with your spouse or partner to create a mutual understanding of the family's finances, get on the same page regarding long-term goals, and ensure you're both prepared if life brings any unexpected situations your way.

Then, once your kids become young adults, bring them up to speed on your family's long-term wealth plan. Scheduling meetings at least twice a year is a good place to start.

Avoid postponing family legacy meetings
There are several reasons to not put off these important discussions.

Sure, it's human nature to think, ""I'll get to it one day"" or ""I'm young and don't really want to talk about my death."" While these can be tough discussions that stir up an array of emotions, they're a great way to prevent speculation or false expectations about your intentions before it's too late.

At some point, you've probably heard stories or seen movies about an estate that isn't distributed equally. A favorite child or grandchild gets more than others and positive family dynamics are disrupted. Legacy meetings go a long way in creating clarity around your decisions and helping family members remain united.

For example, let's say you plan to support one grandchild by paying for culinary school. You respect their passion and want to help them pursue it. But your other grandchild isn't pursuing education. Do you plan to give them the same amount of money to put toward something else like a car or home? Or do you feel that these goals should be financed independently?

Having up-front conversations about your legacy plan can help your family understand and respect your wishes.

Beneficiary designations are important
Did you know you need to designate your IRA beneficiaries as ""per capita"" or ""per stirpes""? Getting it right can make a big difference in how your wealth is transferred and whether it's passed down the way you intend.

With a per capita designation, assets are divided equally among surviving co-beneficiaries, which means nothing will pass on to a deceased beneficiary's heirs.

With a per stirpes designation, if one of your beneficiaries is deceased, their portion will go to their surviving children.Educate your loved ones
Not all couples or family members have a mutual passion for investing. And it's perfectly okay if one person prefers to take the lead when it comes to handling the finances. However, to alleviate a sudden financial burden should something unexpected happen to you, you can:

Establish preexisting relationships with financial partners. Involve your spouse or partner in these meetings and give them a chance to interact with your contacts. Knowing they have trusted professionals to turn to can be extremely comforting if they're not equipped to take on the responsibility alone.
Educate your spouse or partner. Teaching them the basic financial concepts and investing principles they'll need to carry out your legacy will prepare them for the responsibilities that lie ahead. Here are helpful educational resources to get them started.
When it's time to bring your kids into the discussion, sharing your vision and values with them will help guide future decisions.

Discuss these other legacy planning topics
You might think it goes without saying, but don't forget to cover these 2 very important topics.

Person speaking icon in red.
Legal wishes
Share the beneficiaries outlined in your will and on your financial accounts as well as the people designated to make financial and medical decisions on your behalf.

Tip: Remember to update your beneficiaries as needed after big life events such as births or marriages.

List funds drawing.
Financial inventory and contact information
Be sure to keep a secure, easily accessible record of your accounts and include the contact details for the financial associates you consult with (tax planners, advisors, estate planners, trustees, etc.).

And, of course, make sure your loved ones know how to access this information.

Tip: Consolidating your assets and capturing the priority of financial decisions can help simplify the process.

At the end of the day, legacy planning ensures your loved ones are aware of your plans and helps to alleviate their stress during a very emotional time.

,Emergency funds: 4 tips to boost your financial health,"4 emergency savings tips to help set you up for success

1.Determine your target emergency savings amount.
A common rule of thumb is to put aside enough money to cover at least 3 to 6 months' worth of critical living expenses such as your mortgage, rent, insurance, utilities, and other essentials. Of course, the amount you choose and where you save it will be impacted by a variety of personal factors such as your job, income, and expenses.  

Focus on the necessities and not optional things you could cut from your budget, like dining out or entertainment.  

Next, consider how much you can comfortably save each month to begin building your emergency cushion.

If you're in a strong financial position, consider saving more to cover costs beyond 6 months. This can be especially helpful if your income isn't steady or you're in a high-risk industry where layoffs are common.  

On the other hand, if you're struggling to get started, begin with a small amount and build up your savings over time. As little as $50 per month gives you $600 in annual savings. To gradually increase your savings, consider:

Setting aside your annual raise or a portion of your bonus in your emergency accounts.
Looking for small ways you can reduce your daily expenses and begin saving those extra dollars.
Reducing insurance coverage if you're overinsured. While homeowners and auto insurance are necessities, weigh whether it makes sense to forego insurance on electronics, furniture, vacations, and pet care and put that money in your emergency savings.      

2.Keep your emergency savings out of sight.
When it comes to storing your emergency savings, the saying ""out of sight, out of mind"" holds true. Choose an account that's separate from your go-to checking account but still easy to access. Otherwise, if it's only as far away as your everyday debit card, it can be too tempting to tap into your reserves on a whim and squander your savings.

3.Consider splitting your savings between cash and investments.
To protect your money, it's important to set aside some of your emergency funds in a cash account, such as a money market fund or bank savings account.* As your savings increase, so can your returns. So be sure to capitalize on the earnings potential by exploring interest rates before you open an account.

Next, consider investing some of your emergency savings in an accessible, broadly diversified mutual fund or ETF (exchange-traded fund) with minimal tax consequences to help keep up with inflation and maximize your long-term growth potential. These supplemental savings could come in handy if you ever need to make up for an income gap.

Since certain professions and industries are more susceptible than others to unsteady work and layoffs, think about your personal risk of losing your job or experiencing a break in your income. If the risk is low and you have a decent cushion set aside in cash, it may make sense to invest some of your emergency savings. If the risk is high, perhaps an all-cash reserve is the better option for you.

4.Avoid taking on debt to cover an emergency.
Stay focused on building up your emergency reserve. A strong savings momentum can keep you from having to turn to borrowing, which not only increases your debt but can also jeopardize your relationships and long-term goals. That's why it's best to avoid these options if you can:    

Credit cards. Interest rates on credit cards can be sky-high and you can expect to pay fees for any late payments. Your credit score could also suffer if you're unable to make payments on time, which can impact your ability to get more attractive borrowing rates on auto loans, mortgages, or home equity loans.
Loans from family or friends. Money can have a funny way of coming between family and friends, even when both the borrower and lender have good intentions. When you borrow from loved ones, your financial concerns can end up placing a financial burden on them too.
Retirement plan loans or withdrawals.** Using your retirement savings can hurt you more than you might think. When you take a distribution through a loan or withdrawal, you can miss out on years of compounding, which can decrease your chances of meeting your retirement goal. For example, a $10,000 withdrawal may seem like a small drop in the bucket, but over the course of 30 years, it could impact your bottom line by more than $50,000.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/emergency-funds-4-tips-to-boost-your-financial-health,
,Unlock your legacy: Understanding and creating generational wealth,"What is generational wealth?
Generational wealth refers to the wealth and assets that are passed down from one generation to the next within a family or community. This type of wealth is accumulated and built over time and can include financial assets such as property, businesses, stocks, and other investments.

Historically, generational wealth has played a significant role in shaping societies and economies. Many cultures have a tradition of passing down wealth and assets as a way to preserve a family's legacy and provide a sense of security and stability for future generations. To this day, keeping land and businesses in the family is a cornerstone of cultures around the world.

Why is generational wealth important?
The importance of building generational wealth remains crucial, as it can help break the cycle of poverty and provide future generations with opportunities for upward social and economic mobility. It also allows families to weather financial crises and create a sense of stability and security.

,Emergency fund: Why you need one,"What's an emergency fund?
An emergency fund is an amount of money set aside to cover the financial surprises life might throw your way. These unexpected events can be stressful and costly.

Here are some of the most common financial emergencies people face:

Job loss.
Medical or dental expenses.
Unexpected home repairs.
Car troubles.
Unplanned travel expenses.
Healthcare professional discussing a document with an elderly couple
What's the right emergency fund amount?
A common rule of thumb suggests that to be conservative, people should have 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses set aside for emergency financial needs—notably unexpected expenses or changes to income.

There are two main reasons to tap into your emergency funds: spending shocks and income shocks.

Spending shocks. Spending shocks are relatively common unanticipated expenses. They can include costs such as unforeseen health care needs, home repairs, or other unplanned costs. To prepare yourself for potential spending shocks, experts suggest it's best to aim to save half a month's worth of living expenses or $2,000—whichever is greater.

Income shocks. Income shocks may arise less frequently than spending shocks and are instances such as unexpected job loss or a notable decline in income. To prepare for income shocks, many experts suggest keeping enough money in your emergency fund to cover 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses. 

So if you spend $5,000 per month, your first emergency fund savings milestone should be $2,500 to cover spending shocks. For your longer-term goal of an emergency fund that will cover income shocks, aim to save $15,000 to $30,000 total.

A range of other factors could influence how much you need to allocate toward your emergency fund. 

Income      
Dependents        
Income variability        
Spending flexibility       
Job security     
Job skills   
Insurance    
Alternative financing        
Portfolio compositionWhere to put your emergency fund
Since spending shocks can occur at any time, investments that offer safety and liquidity are most appropriate for emergency savings. These can be checking and savings accounts, money market funds, or cash management accounts, such as the Vanguard Cash Plus Account.

When deciding how to allocate your savings, Vanguard recommends you consider the following:

Ease of account use
A checking or savings account features an account and routing number which you can use for everyday spending needs and recurring payments, in addition to easy access to your money to meet emergency financial needs. Checking and savings accounts also offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance, protecting you against a loss of account balances if those institutions were to fail financially.

Conversely, money market funds are typically held within a brokerage account and represent a type of mutual fund that invests in extremely short-term, highly liquid securities. Money market funds held within a brokerage account may be eligible for Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage. Similar to FDIC insurance, SIPC coverage protects brokerage accounts if the firms were to fail financially.

Yield or return
Although checking and savings accounts and money market funds represent some of the safest and most liquid options, these choices vary in terms of the yields or returns they offer on your savings. For example, in most cases, money market funds offer a higher yield than checking accounts offer. But overall, when you allocate savings to cash, you choose to trade the potential investment return of a balanced portfolio for the security of better preserving your principal amount. That's why choosing a competitive yield that can help increase the value of your cash portfolio is a critical consideration in addition to safety. 

 

What options does Vanguard offer for emergency savings?
Vanguard recently introduced the Cash Plus Account as our savings account alternative that can help support investors in achieving their emergency savings goals.

The Cash Plus Account provides access to:

A competitive annual percentage yield (APY) of 3.65%—notably higher than the 0.42% average savings account interest rate.1
Familiar bank account features such as an account number and routing number.2
Up to 5x the FDIC insurance you can get from a single bank.3
The Vanguard Cash Plus program APY (annual percentage yield) is 3.65% as of January 6, 2025. The APY will vary and may change at any time. Source for average bank savings yield of 0.42%: FDIC National Rates and Rate Caps as of December 16, 2024.

Many of our clients use the Cash Plus Account not only for emergency savings, but also for daily cash needs. For instance, the Cash Plus Account can work with payment apps such as Venmo or PayPal for everyday use.2 In addition, the Cash Plus Account provides the option to invest in money market funds, including municipal money market funds for investors in higher tax brackets who could benefit from tax-free income on their savings. Ultimately, the Cash Plus Account allows Vanguard investors to pursue their holistic financial goals, both for the short and long term, in one place.

Benefits of having an emergency fund
Aside from financial stability, there are other pros to having an emergency reserve of cash.

It can prevent you from making bad financial decisions
There may be other ways you can quickly access cash, like borrowing, but at what cost? Well, there are interest charges, fees, and penalties—to name a few. Ultimately, a primary benefit of achieving an emergency savings goal is avoiding expensive financing for unplanned costs, such as the use of credit card debt or other high-interest options.
 
It can help reduce stress
It's no surprise that when life presents an emergency that threatens your financial well-being, it causes stress. Going through life without a safety net is living on the financial edge, hoping to get by without running into a crisis.

Being prepared with an emergency fund gives you the confidence to tackle unexpected events without adding money worries to your list.
 
It can keep you from spending on a whim
You've heard the saying ""out of sight, out of mind."" That's the best way to store your emergency money. By putting it in a separate account, you'll know exactly how much you have—and how much you may still need to save. And you'll be less inclined to tap into it before the need arises.


How to build an emergency fund in 6 steps
How can you get started on building an emergency fund? Let's chart the course.

1.Tackle any debt
Significantly reducing or eliminating credit card or other high-interest debt is essential before building toward an emergency savings goal.

2.Set a savings goal
It's important to consider an emergency savings goal within the context of a broader personal financial plan. Budget a savings goal into your monthly expenses, make a plan for where to save, and stick to it.

3.Stash away smaller amounts on a regular basis
Every week or every paycheck, put a little away. 

4.Take advantage of onetime opportunities
Did you get a bonus at work or a tax refund? Consider adding it to your savings. 

5.Consider direct deposit
You may be able to direct a portion of each paycheck to a separate account that's set up for emergency savings. If it's automatic, you won't forget. And if you keep it up, over time you'll be more likely to meet your goal.

6.Start today
The important thing is to start saving something. For instance, let's say you set aside $25 each week in emergency savings. By the end of 2 years, you could have $2,600 plus all of the interest you've earned over that time—which will continue to compound as your savings grow. Then imagine if you increase the amount to $50 each week. Your savings could grow to $5,200—plus interest. Make it $75 each week and you could have over $7,800! The sooner you start, the more you can compound—so you can see why waiting to save gets expensive.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/emergency-fund/why-you-need-one,
,"Understanding the 529 plan ""grandparent loophole""","What is the 529 grandparent loophole?
Previously, distributions from the plan could reduce the recipient's financial aid by up to 50% of the distribution amount. For example, a $25,000 distribution from a grandparent-owned 529 could mean a $12,500 reduction in a student's financial aid package.

Starting in the 2024–2025 academic year, the simplified FAFSA no longer requires cash support or distributions from a grandparent-owned 529 to be reported. With this update, you can help your loved ones pay for their education without affecting their eligibility for financial aid.


Benefits
529 plans aren't just valuable to the beneficiary. They can also enable you to transfer wealth to your loved ones in a tax-advantaged way.

Tax advantages
529 plans provide federal tax benefits, including tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified education expenses.1 You can contribute up to $18,000 annually ($36,000 for a married couple) per beneficiary without having to pay gift taxes. Additionally, you may be able to deduct your contributions from your state income tax—or get a state tax credit—depending on where you live.2

Flexibility
Your loved ones can have multiple 529 accounts in their name and use the savings for K–12 tuition, trade and vocational schools, tuition payments, room and board, apprenticeship programs, and graduate schools in the U.S. or abroad. And if they decide not to use the money for education, you have 2 options. You can either roll over up to $35,000 to a Roth IRA in their name after 15 years or change the beneficiary to another qualifying family member (including yourself).3

Considerations
While the benefits of investing in a 529 plan are extensive, there are a few potential financial impacts to prepare for before starting to contribute.


Impacts to financial aid
Although the simplified FAFSA no longer requires that grandparent-owned 529 plan distributions be reported, the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile—used by some private colleges to award their institutional aid—will still request information about 529s owned by relatives other than parents and may affect the aid the student receives.


Withdrawal penalties
Owners of 529 accounts can withdraw the money at any point. However, you'll have to pay income taxes on earnings along with a 10% penalty if the funds aren't used for qualified education expenses. Keep in mind that 529 plans are flexible and can be used for a variety of educational purposes or transferred to other beneficiaries—including yourself!

Investing in a 529 plan can be a meaningful way for you to play a part in in your loved ones' future accomplishments. With the grandparent loophole, your contributions can make even more of a difference for them. If you're still weighing whether a 529 is right for you, here are a few resources that can help.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/education-college-savings/529-grandparent-loophole,
